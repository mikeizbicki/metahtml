<p>A brutal insurgency under way in Mozambique’s northernmost province 
that escalated in 2019 has raised fears that an Islamist jihad movement 
is seeking to establish itself in southern <a href="file:///topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Africa">Africa</a>.</p>
<p>South Africa-based terrorism expert <a href="file:///topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jasmine+Opperman">Jasmine Opperman</a>
 says the Islamic State terror group has claimed responsibility for 
nearly two dozen of the 189 attacks perpetrated by a shadowy extremist 
group last year in <a href="file:///topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Cabo+Delgado">Cabo Delgado</a>, a rural resource-rich area of <a href="file:///topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Mozambique">Mozambique</a> bordering <a href="file:///topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Tanzania">Tanzania</a>.</p>
<p>Since it first attacked police stations in the port town Mocímboa da 
Praia on October 5th, 2017, the group has left a trail of mutilated 
bodies and burned-out villages behind it, forcing at least 65,000 
Mozambicans to become internal refugees.</p>
<p>Opperman, who is the Africa associate at the Islamic Theology of 
Counter Terrorism, a UK-based think tank, estimates up to 500 civilians,
 insurgents and security personnel have died in the group’s attacks so 
far.</p>
<p>“Isis [Islamic State] has claimed responsibility for 23 attacks in 
Cabo Delgado and I have been able to link 18 of these to verified 
incidents,” says Opperman, who added it was still unclear if the group, 
also known as Isis, played a role in the attacks, or if the local 
extremist group was now its regional proxy.</p>
<p>The increase in the Cabo Delgado group’s military operations in 2019 
has continued into January 2020, according to Opperman, who says at 
least nine attacks against villages and security forces have been 
confirmed so far this month.</p>
<p>Last year’s escalation in violence reportedly coincided with the 
arrival of 203 well-armed Russian mercenaries – from a paramilitary 
force called the Wagner Group – in the province in September, who were 
deployed to support the Mozambique Defence Armed Forces’ anti-terror 
operations there.</p>
<p>However, South Africa’s Daily Maverick newspaper reported on November
 29th that 11 of the Wagner Group’s soldiers were killed and a further 
25 injured, in three separate battles with the militants.</p>
<h4>Al-Shabaab</h4>
<p>“The soldiers left in Mozambique have retreated as far as their base in Nacala [the capital of <a href="file:///topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Nampula">Nampula</a> Province] where they were retraining, acclimatising and gathering intelligence,” the online publication stated.</p>
<p>Known locally as al-Shabaab, though it has not been directly linked 
to the Somalia-based regional terror organisation of the same name, the 
Cabo Delgado group’s leadership and fighting strength is not well-known.</p>
<p>There are seven to 10 terror cells moving around the province 
conducting attacks, says Opperman, but “their military strength is 
unknown, and it is unclear if the cells co-ordinate their attacks, or 
follow an overarching ideology”.</p>
<p>However, in December the group posted pictures on Twitter for the 
first time that showed its fighters with captured police vehicles and 
uniforms, and in one of the images a young man is holding an IS flag.</p>
<p>At the very least Islamic State’s claim of responsibility for 23 
attacks in Cabo Delgado and the local groups use of its symbolism 
suggests they are using each other to attract international attention. 
But Opperman believes it is crucial to establish if their ties run 
deeper.</p>
<p>She also warned that Mozambique, itself a post-war state, appears 
ill-equipped to deal with the insurgency and that the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC) – the main regional intergovernmental body 
in southern Africa – has yet to outline how it might deal with a 
jihadist threat in the region.</p>
<p>“We have a serious situation on our hands in Cabo Delgado, but SADC 
has been silent about it so far. I can’t understand it, because we need a
 regional structure and strategy to deal with this [conflict].” 
Mozambique’s Frelimo-led government, which was re-elected last year, has
 so far revealed little about the group since it emerged, only saying 
the insurgents comprise local unemployed “criminals” and that the 
attacks are linked to global jihadists.</p>
<p>Efforts to find out more about the extremists and their motives have 
also been hampered by the government’s decision in 2018 to ban 
journalists and researchers from working in areas targeted by the 
insurgents.</p>
<h4>Radicalisation research</h4>
<p>However, a study last September by the Maputo-based Institute of 
Social and Economic Studies titled, “Islamic Radicalisation in Northern 
Mozambique: The Case of Mocímboa da Praia” provides insights into how 
and why extremism has emerged in the province.</p>
<p>According to Cabo Delgado residents interviewed for the study, the 
men who initially launched the insurgency came to the fore in 2014 in a 
religious group who wanted locals to adhere to an extreme form of 
Islamic law.</p>
<p>When this was opposed by local religious leaders, who expelled the 
extremists from their mosques, the group began to incorporate military 
cells into its structures in 2015, training recruits in military camps 
hidden in local forests.</p>
<p>“At first, the group’s members were mainly young people from Mocímboa
 da Praia, but their leaders had links with certain religious and 
military circles – fundamentalist Islamic cells in Tanzania, <a href="file:///topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="file:///topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Somalia">Somalia</a> and the Great Lakes region,” the study states.</p>
<p>The researchers also found the young people who joined the group were
 motivated by poverty or unemployment; the need for camaraderie; a 
desire for adventure; or a compulsion to create a new order in the 
province that would benefit them.</p>
<p>“Al-Shabaab gave young recruits from Mocímboa da Praia and other 
districts a sense of security, support and community – they satisfied 
the youth’s emotional needs,” the study found.</p>
<p>There is no reference to Islamic State or its militants being involved in the Cabo Delgado insurgency in the report.</p>
<p><a href="file:///topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Joseph+Hanlon">Joseph Hanlon</a>,
 a UK-based academic and journalist who has followed Mozambique’s 
development for decades, believes that poverty rather than an extremist 
ideology is the insurgency’s main driver.</p>
<p>In the December edition of his Mozambique Bulletin, he wrote that 
rather than Islamic State being the hidden hand behind the insurgency, 
“all the evidence is that this is a local uprising fuelled by growing 
poverty and inequality – most of the land has been taken [from the 
people] for mining so there is no free farmland, and inequality is 
increasing”.</p>
