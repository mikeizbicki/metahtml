<h1 class="rm-manual">How the Iranian Government Shut Off the Internet</h1>
<p>After years of centralizing internet control, Iran pulled the plug on connectivity for nearly all of its citizens.</p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span></figcaption><p><span>Amid widespread demonstrations</span>
 over rising gasoline prices, Iranians began experiencing internet 
slowdowns over the past few days that became a near-total internet and 
mobile data blackout on Saturday. The government is apparently seeking 
to silence protesters and quell unrest. So how does a country like Iran <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2019/11/17/Iran-in-near-total-national-internet-shutdown-amid-ongoing-protests.html" rel="nofollow noopener">switch off internet access</a> to a population of more than 80 million? It's not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>Though some countries, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/10/ff-chinafirewall/">namely China</a>,
 architected their internet infrastructure from the start with 
government control in mind, most don't have a central set of levers they
 can pull to influence countrywide access to content or connectivity. 
But regimes around the world, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-internet-disconnect-what-happens/">including those in Russia</a>
 and Iran, have increasingly been retrofitting traditional private and 
decentralized networks with cooperation agreements, technical implants, 
or a combination to give officials more influence. In countries like 
Ethiopia, Venezuela, and Iraq, along with disputed regions like Kashmir,
 government-led social media blocking and more extensive outages have 
become the norm.</p>
<p>“This is the most wide-scale internet shutdown that we’ve seen in 
Iran,” says Adrian Shahbaz, research director at the pro-democracy group
 Freedom House, which tracks internet censorship and restriction 
worldwide. “It’s surprising to see the Iranian authorities block all 
internet connections rather than only international internet 
connections, because the latter is a tactic that they’ve used in the 
past. It could mean they are more fearful of their own people and worry 
that they cannot control the information space amidst these economic 
protests.”</p>
<p>The process to block an entire country's internet connectivity 
depends on the set-up. Places like Ethiopia that have relatively limited
 internet proliferation typically have just one government-controlled 
internet service provider, perhaps alongside some smaller private ISPs. 
But all usually gain access from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-undersea-internet-cables/">a single undersea cable</a>
 or international network node, creating upstream choke points that 
officials can use to essentially block a country's connectivity at its 
source.</p>
<p>The more extensive and diverse a country's infrastructure, though, 
the more involved the digital blackout process becomes. Alp Toker, the 
director of nonpartisan connectivity tracking group NetBlocks, says it 
took Iranian authorities about 24 hours to completely block the nation's
 inbound and outbound traffic—leaving it hovering at about 5 to 7 
percent of typical connectivity levels. Top politicians, like the 
country's supreme leader, Seyed Ali Khamenei, have <a href="https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1195298676123537409" rel="nofollow noopener">still been using Twitter</a> and other public platforms.</p>
<p>"The more networks and connections a country has, the more difficult it is to cut access for good."</p>
<p>Security researcher Lukasz Olejnik</p>
<p>In a country without one or two obvious digital bottlenecks, 
authorities must coordinate with multiple telecoms, including ISPs and 
mobile data providers, to cut access. And they also need to overcome 
redundancies and algorithmic protections meant to make networks 
resilient in case of unintentional outages or bugs. For example, the 
internet is designed with failsafe properties that allow it to sort of 
quarantine and route around areas of a network that are suffering 
connectivity issues or other instability. NetBlocks' Toker says that 
perhaps Iran's internet slowdowns in the lead-up to the full outage were
 the result of telecoms working on behalf of the government to 
essentially defeat their own system reliability protections.</p>
<p>"To shut down a country's access to internet, it takes a lot of 
preparations. We are talking about software and hardware layers, and 
also regulatory frameworks," says Lukasz Olejnik, an independent 
security and privacy adviser and research associate at the Center for 
Technology and Global Affairs at Oxford University. "The more networks 
and connections a country has, the more difficult it is to cut access 
for good. And the question also is whether you want to cut in-country 
network access, too, in addition to flows between the country and 
outside world."</p>
<p>Increasingly over the past decade, the Iranian regime has focused on 
building out a centralized national "intranet." That allows it to 
provide citizens with web services while policing all content on the 
network and limiting information from external sources. Known as the 
"National information network" or SHOMA, the effort has centered on the 
state-owned Telecommunication Company of Iran, which is run by a number 
of former government officials. In the process of establishing this 
internal web, the Iranian regime has taken more and more control over 
both public and private connectivity in the name of national security.</p>
<p>That means Iran is also able to exert pressure even on ostensibly 
independent internet providers. NetBlocks' Toker points out, for 
example, that his organization saw three Iranian mobile data carriers 
shut off seemingly in unison on Saturday. Still, he and other analysts 
emphasize that it's difficult to know exactly what has happened or why 
Iran's networks are specifically designed the way they are.</p>
<p>"In Iran, convincing operators probably isn’t the most challenging 
task, because all of this has been normalized to a certain degree," says
 Toker. "But there's no indication of a national kill switch in this 
case. Around the world it seems like there's a sort of playbook that’s 
developing, though."</p>
<p>That playbook chiefly involves the ability, one way or the other, to 
send the command for ISPs to shut it all down. It's a more involved 
request than blocking a specific platform like Twitter, another popular 
approach among Iran and other oppressive governments. That takes 
selective filtering rather than a near-total blackout. As of Sunday 
evening local time, Iran’s internet was still down.</p>
<p>"It’s not going to work. Information is going to continue to spread by other means."</p>
<p>Adrian Shahbaz, Freedom House</p>
<p>The United Nations has <a href="https://www.article19.org/data/files/Internet_Statement_Adopted.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">explicitly identified</a>
 government-led internet shutdowns and censorship as a human rights 
violation. But numerous governments have been pushing the limits of how 
much they can curtail connectivity without facing reprisals from the 
international community. And just this week, United States UN 
representatives and others <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/the-us-is-urging-a-no-vote-on-a-russian-led-un-resolution-calling-for-a-global-cybercrime-treaty/2019/11/16/b4895e76-075e-11ea-818c-fcc65139e8c2_story.html" rel="nofollow noopener">warned</a>
 that a Russian-led cybercrime resolution that will face a UN vote 
Monday is really a treaty that could be interpreted to allow government 
internet control. Even countries like the United Kingdom have started 
developing and passing <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21" rel="nofollow noopener">national security regulations</a> that could allow a government to block an ISP.</p>
<p>But Freedom House's Shahbaz points out that this creep toward 
increasing internet censorship is more complicated in practice than just
 flipping a switch. He adds that widespread internet shutdowns don't 
always have a repressive regime's desired effect. For better or worse, 
an internet blackout limits the government's ability to conduct digital 
surveillance on citizens. And it can foster camaraderie among citizens 
that can turn into even more powerful protest movements.</p>
<p>"This is a very blunt attempt to control the information space in 
Iran by simply just denying individuals access to all information," 
Shahbaz says. "And it’s not going to work. Information is going to 
continue to spread by other means. And, actually, sometimes shutting off
 the internet just drives people to the streets."</p>
