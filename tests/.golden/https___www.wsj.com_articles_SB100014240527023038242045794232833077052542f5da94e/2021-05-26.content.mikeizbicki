<p>Warning: Don't let your pets crack your nest egg.</p>
<p>Older adults today are spending considerably more on Fido and Fluffy 
than they did in 1990, according to a new report from the National 
Center for Policy Analysis, a nonprofit, nonpartisan public-policy 
research organization based in Dallas.</p>

<p>In fact, for 65- to 74-year-olds, one of the five fastest-growing 
categories of spending is pets and hobbies, which has grown 5.2% a year 
on average since 1990, according to Pamela Villarreal, the author of the
 report.</p>
<p>To be fair, the pets and hobbies category includes expenses not only 
for pets and pet supplies, but also toys, games, tricycles and 
playground equipment. Still, some experts are worried that left 
unchecked, pet expenses could be a budget buster for some people in 
retirement.</p>
<p>"The topic of pet expense is rarely discussed," says Richard Rosso, a
 senior financial adviser with Clarity Financial LLC, a Houston-based 
financial-planning firm. "But it shouldn't be ignored."</p>
<p>So, what are some ways to keep pet expenses from becoming a problem? </p>
<h6 class="">Plan It Out</h6>
<p>As with most budget items, keeping track of projected and actual 
expenses is important. "Expenditures on pets, like every line item in a 
retiree's budget, should be planned," says Andrea Blackwelder, a 
certified financial planner and founder and president of Wisdom Wealth 
Strategies LLC, a Denver-based financial-planning firm. Several groups 
offer online estimates of the cost of caring for various pets, including
 the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (<a href="http://www.aspca.org/adopt/pet-care-costs">aspca.org/adopt/pet-care-costs</a>) and Petfinder (go to <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/pet-care/">petfinder.com/pet-care</a> and enter "care costs" in the "search our articles" box).</p>
<figcaption> <span> - </span> </figcaption><p>Ms. Blackwelder says those
 nearing retirement or already retired who pine to buy a pet must 
consider that animals are a "long, long-term" commitment. For those on a
 tight budget, she adds, larger breeds of dogs, which tend to be more 
costly, "are probably not a good choice."</p>
<p>When creating a pet budget, factor in unexpected costs, too. Ms. 
Blackwelder cites the example of a recent retiree whose retriever ate 
broken glass while the owner was traveling. "The final cost of the 
treatment was nearly $4,000," Ms. Blackwelder says. "Retirees must 
consider whether their cushion or reserve assets allow for such costs."</p>
<h6>Controlling Costs</h6>
<p>Consider pet health insurance. Premiums, according to Mr. Rosso, can 
range from $10 to $40 a month depending on the coverage you require and 
the size, breed and age of your pet. Be sure you understand exactly what
 is and isn't covered by any policy.</p>
<p>There are ways to cut costs for routine health expenses as well. Ms. 
Villarreal recommends taking advantage of specials on low-cost 
vaccinations available at some pet stores and shelters. And when 
shopping for pet medications, compare your veterinarian's prices with 
those of mail-order and online suppliers, she says.</p>
<p>Two options for retirees who decide against buying pets but who yearn
 for their company: pet sitting or pet walking as a part-time job, or 
volunteering at an animal shelter. </p>
<p>"Pet sitting is a wonderful, low-commitment, flexible way to be 
around pets without the cost of owning the animals," Ms. Blackwelder 
says. "If volunteering is more attractive, retirees can be extremely 
helpful at local shelters and at nonprofit organizations." </p>
