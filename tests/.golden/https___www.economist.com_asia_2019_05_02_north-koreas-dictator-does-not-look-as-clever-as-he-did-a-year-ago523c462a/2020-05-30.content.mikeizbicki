<p class="rm-manual">May 2nd 2019</p>
<p><span>I</span>T IS A year since a nuclear-armed Kim Jong Un set off 
on a diplomatic dance drawing in the leaders of China, South Korea, the 
United States and now Russia. The flamboyant approach has turned the 
family dictatorship’s decades of dour reclusiveness on their head and 
done much for the North Korean leader’s standing at home and abroad. 
Korea-watchers say it has increased Mr Kim’s room for manoeuvre and so, 
by extension, his odds of survival. What a brilliant young despot. 
Perhaps he really will die peacefully in his bed.</p>
<p>Last year, on April 27th, Mr Kim met his South Korean counterpart, 
Moon Jae-in, at Panmunjom, the “truce village” where the armistice 
halting Korea’s civil war had been signed 65 years earlier. Even a 
hardened press corps gasped at the symbolism. The two held three summits
 in six months, where predecessors had managed just two in decades. They
 promised all manner of joint co-operation. Mr Kim has also met four 
times with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, with whom he even celebrated his 
birthday.</p>
<p>As a spectacular, nothing beat Mr Kim’s summit with Donald Trump last
 June in Singapore. It was followed by a second meeting, in February in 
Hanoi. Better late to the dance than never, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s 
president, rolled out the red carpet for Mr Kim last month.</p>
<p>But as full as Mr Kim’s dance card has been, the only flirtation that
 matters is with Mr Trump. Only America presents a serious military 
threat, and can unlock UN sanctions imposed in response to North Korea’s
 drive to develop nuclear bombs and long-range missiles. Yet the summit 
in Hanoi ended in failure. It seems Mr Kim overplayed his hand, 
expecting Mr Trump to be eager for a deal that would see at least some 
sanctions eased in exchange for an incomplete dismantling of his nuclear
 programme. He was taken aback to learn that the Americans knew of a 
secret nuclear facility that had not been part of discussions. Mr Trump 
walked away.</p>
<p>A blow for Mr Kim, and he may not be responding cannily. It is nice 
to be treated as an equal by Mr Putin, but it gives him little leverage 
with Mr Trump. Mr Putin loves to needle and upstage America, but he is 
not about to bail out the failed North Korean state.</p>
<p>Where Mr Kim has real agency is in his dealings with Mr Moon, whose 
efforts brought Mr Kim and Mr Trump together. Yet he is blowing it. In 
South Korea the anniversary of the Panmunjom summit was celebrated with 
international musicians and a video message from the Pope. Conspicuously
 absent was any North Korean representation.</p>
<p>Out of pique at stalled nuclear talks, North Korea is taking things 
out on the South. All Panmunjom talk of co-operation has gone. In a 
speech last month Mr Kim attacked Mr Moon, complaining about South 
Korean authorities “posing as a meddlesome ‘mediator’” just after the 
South Korean president had visited the White House to urge Mr Trump to 
keep up the diplomacy.</p>
<p>It is a return to shrill North Korean form. The South is being blamed
 for not doing more to keep America dancing. Abusing Mr Moon is surely 
foolish, says Aidan Foster-Carter, a longtime Korea-watcher. Mr Moon is 
keen to keep rapprochement going, but is struggling to bring South 
Koreans along with him. They backed the detente last year. But many have
 since lost faith in North Korean promises, and interest in 
reunification. The approval ratings of hawkish conservatives have 
soared. In power they would make life far harder for Mr Kim.</p>
<p>Even Mr Kim’s approach towards America is questionable. He still 
appears to assume that Mr Trump will deal. His leverage is less his 
nuclear threat than Mr Trump’s claim last year to have done away with it
 (after Mr Kim suspended his nuclear testing). A test last month of a 
new short-range guided missile seems calculated to remind the American 
president that Mr Kim has the power to embarrass him.</p>
<p>Is that, along with the regime’s attacks on Mike Pompeo, Mr Trump’s 
chief diplomat, wise? Even Mr Trump would struggle to seal a bad deal in
 the face of sceptical advisers. Meanwhile, sanctions continue to bite, 
despite help from Chinese and Russian sanctions-busters. Mr Kim seems 
minded to respond more by snarling, perhaps with more tests, than by 
charming. For America and its friends, it hints at a return to a lousy 
set of options for dealing with North Korea. But it means lousy options 
for the young despot too. So much for Mr Kim’s supposed brilliance.</p>
