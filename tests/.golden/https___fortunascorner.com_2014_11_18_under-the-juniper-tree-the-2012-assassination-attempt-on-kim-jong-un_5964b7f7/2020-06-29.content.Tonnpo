<p>Stepping into this breach, on November 4 this year reporter Joo 
Seong-ha of the Donga Ilbo published an article in which he outlined 
evidence of a plot to kill Kim Jong-un two years earlier. According to 
Joo, citing inside source testimony, the plan would have seen Kim shot 
with a firearm hidden beforehand beneath a juniper tree in central 
Pyongyang. However, the weapon was discovered, the security services 
alerted, and the plot foiled. Before long, the finger of blame turned 
toward none other than Jang Song-taek, and a surveillance operation 
began.</p>
<p>The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>And such rumors should make us think about the questions of what we 
(the ROK and the ROK/US Alliance) do if Kim Jong-un was assassinated and
 are we prepared to handle the likely fallout from such an assassination
 – either internal conflict and civil war in the north Korea or an 
emergent leader who really wants to change or even wants to seek real 
unification?</p>

<p>A year on, the execution of Jang Song-taek in December 2013 continues
 to amaze casual and professional observers of North Korea alike. In 
part this is due to the sheer scale of the show. Although a number of 
astute South Korean scholars of politics had predicted that, based upon 
the brutal logic of Suryongist absolutism in transition, Kim Jong-un’s 
uncle would eventually have to be purged, nobody had anticipated it to 
be so public or wantonly brutal.</p>
<p>The passing of time has only marginally improved our understanding of
 what happened during the period of Jang’s investigation, purge and 
eventual death. In justifying the decision to kill him, the North Korean
 regime published an extensive judgment in Rodong Sinmun. It outlined 
the charges laid against him, but the list was so long and the charges 
so varied that it was impossible to parse effectively; it did not get us
 much further forward than we had previously been. Diligent work from 
New Focus (for instance here) provided a number of pieces of the puzzle 
and rendered a logical narrative, but some questions remained 
unanswered.</p>
<p>Stepping into this breach, on November 4 this year reporter Joo 
Seong-ha of the Donga Ilbo published an article in which he outlined 
evidence of a plot to kill Kim Jong-un two years earlier. According to 
Joo, citing inside source testimony, the plan would have seen Kim shot 
with a firearm hidden beforehand beneath a juniper tree in central 
Pyongyang. However, the weapon was discovered, the security services 
alerted, and the plot foiled. Before long, the finger of blame turned 
toward none other than Jang Song-taek, and a surveillance operation 
began.</p>
<p>The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>Joo Seong-ha, “Truth of assassination attempt on Kim Jong-un two 
years ago public for first time” [2년 전 김정은 암살시도 진실 최초 공개], Donga.com and
 Nambuk Story, November 4, 2014.</p>
<p>This Jangmadang owes a debt of gratitude to The Korean, who kindly 
liaised with Sino-NK to facilitate simultaneous posting with his blog, 
Ask a Korean. Like Sino-NK, The Korean is a great supporter of reporter 
Joo Seong-ha’s personal blog Nambuk Story, from which he drew the 
original article. – Editor</p>
<p>Two years ago, on November 3, 2012, there was an assassination 
attempt on Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. That day, Kim was scheduled to 
visit Munsu Street in Pyongyang. There, he was set to go to 
Ryugyeongwon, a health club; People’s Outdoor Skating Rink; and a roller
 skating rink. These facilities were only several tens of meters away 
from one another, with a street in between them.</p>
<p>On the morning of that day, a loaded machine gun was discovered 
cleverly hidden under a low-growing juniper tree near Ryugyeongwon. The 
gun was immediately reported to the Ministry of State Security. It was 
clearly an attempt on Kim Jong-un’s life. The assassins were apparently 
aiming for Kim Jong-un’s visit to the area. Even so, Kim Jong-un 
summoned enough courage to visit as scheduled.</p>
<p>The North Korean regime never found who was responsible. But the 
predominant speculation is that a high-ranking person must have been 
behind it. Kim Jong-un’s line of movement is top secret, with few 
knowing where he is planned to be. Also, it had to be someone who could 
smuggle a machine gun in from abroad, as firearms are strictly 
controlled in North Korea.</p>
<p>Soon, Kim Jong-un’s uncle Jang Song-taek was named the most likely 
suspect. The Internal Defense Force (IDF) of the Ministry of People’s 
Security, which [was then] under Jang’s command, had built the 
facilities that Kim Jong-un was due to visit. It was also the generals 
of the IDF who greeted Kim Jong-un at those facilities. But Jang could 
not be arrested based on speculation alone. Therefore, from that time, 
the regime relentlessly spied on him.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, Jang Song-taek disappeared from the public 
eye thereafter. In South Korea it was rumored that he had already been 
purged. Jang did reappear, but there were only 13 media appearances up 
to mid-April 2013. In 2012, Jang had accompanied Kim Jong-un 102 times.</p>
<p>To this day, the assassination attempt on Kim Jong-un is top secret, 
with only a few people knowing that it ever happened. I received this 
information some time ago, but did not report on it for the sake of my 
informant’s safety. This is a significant event, and not simply because 
it happened-although that alone is shocking enough. It is also 
significant because it is a major piece of the puzzle that explains 
North Korea’s irregular behavior following the event.</p>
<p>Immediately after the attempt, there were 100 armored cars placed 
around 30 facilities that Kim Jong-un uses, i.e. administrative offices 
and residences. The South Korean government also noticed this unusual 
activity approximately a month later. In early December, a South Korean 
official said: “Unlike before, Kim Jong-un’s visits now feature heavily 
armored bodyguards, and there are armored cars nearby. We presume that 
there was a large protest in North Korea, or there may be someone who is
 unhappy with his position in the government.”</p>
<p>This was evident from North Korean media as well. Previously when the
 North Korean media covered Kim Jong-un’s visits, bodyguards rarely 
appeared. If they did, they were armed only with handguns. But after the
 assassination attempt, bodyguards with automatic weapons and helmets 
appeared blatantly in the photos. There were also photos of bodyguards 
with a golf bag or guitar case, which presumably carried a machine gun, 
sniper rifle, or other heavy weaponry.</p>
<p>Apparently rattled, Kim Jong-un visited the Ministry of State 
Security twice in November, ordering a purge of hostile elements. In the
 same month, North Korea held a National Police Chief’s Assembly and a 
National Judicial Worker’s Assembly three days apart. The former was the
 first in 13 years; the latter in 30 years. At these assemblies, Kim 
Jong-un ordered: “We must discover all the impure hostile elements who 
maliciously instigate mutinies and chaos; those who wait for the time 
with a knife hidden inside.”</p>
<p>A campaign to eliminate impure elements began at the same time. Every
 North Korean governmental organization was told to submit a report on 
how many hostile elements it had apprehended. North Korean defectors 
testify that this was the period in which the reign of terror reached 
its extreme peak. In January the following year, North Korea declared a 
quasi-state of war, raising tensions to the maximal level both 
internally and externally.</p>
<p>After the assassination attempt, the bodyguard radius for Kim Jong-un
 was doubled. Previously, the intensive security zone-that within which a
 sniper attack would be possible-was 2km. Afterward, the radius was made
 4km. The secondary guard area, in which one could conceivably launch a 
hand-held missile, went from 20km to 40km.</p>
<p>Clearly, the assassination attempt shocked Kim Jong-un. This was the 
time when the top brass of the military constantly changed, presumably 
because Kim’s distrust of the military was at its peak. By July 2013, 
more than half of North Korea’s commanders had been replaced. The 
generals’ ranks changed constantly as well.</p>
<p>Recently, Kim Jong-un has been traveling more on his personal jet. 
While some have seen this as a show of confidence in his safety, the 
opposite may be the case. Traveling by land covers a lot of ground and 
takes time. If someone knows the schedule ahead of time and hides an 
explosive along the way, it is difficult to prevent an attack. In 
contrast, the personal jet only requires control over the airport and a 
small number of support staff.</p>
<p>Of course, South Korean radar shows Kim Jong-un’s personal jet. And 
Kim has been taking a wooden boat right in front of the South Korean 
navy. It appears that Kim is confident that neither South Korea nor the 
United States will assassinate him, causing the chaos of a North Korean 
collapse. In contrast, he seems to fear the interior of North Korea 
more; during his three years, Kim Jong-un has not visited more than half
 of North Korea.</p>
<p>As of now, there is no way to know if Jang Song-taek attempted to 
assassinate Kim Jong-un, or if the purge of Jang has anything to do with
 this attempt. But after Jang was executed, a picture appeared on the 
pages of the South Korean media. In the picture, Jang was standing with 
his hands behind him, while others were busy clapping-the implication 
was that Jang had lost Kim Jong-un’s favor by being arrogant. That 
picture was from November 3, 2012. I wonder what Jang Song-taek was 
thinking that day; but his thoughts are now buried forever.</p>
