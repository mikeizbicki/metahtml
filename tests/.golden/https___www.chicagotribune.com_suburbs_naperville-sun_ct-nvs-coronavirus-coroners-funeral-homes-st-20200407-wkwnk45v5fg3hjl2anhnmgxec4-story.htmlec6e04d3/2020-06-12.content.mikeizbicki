<p> Surrounded by blue temporary fencing, an unmarked refrigerated 
semi-trailer sits quietly in the back of the DuPage County coroner’s 
office, waiting for what suburban coroners predict will be a sharp 
uptick in COVID-19 deaths in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p> Coroners in Kane County and Lake County <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/ct-lns-lake-county-virus-projections-st-0331-20200330-3npua4r76zhivgvb7244lhszxq-story.html">have brought in similar refrigerated vehicles</a>,
 sometimes called mobile morgues, for the first time. Last week, Cook 
County’s medical examiner secured a refrigerated warehouse that can 
store at least 1,000 bodies.</p>
<p> The ominous preparations come as coroners and funeral home directors
 across the suburbs brace for what could be a surge in bodies with not 
enough space to store them all, especially as some families delay 
burying loved ones until it is safe for large groups to gather again.</p>
<p> Kane County Coroner Rob Russell projects his county could have 300 to 1,000 death connected to coronavirus.</p>
<p> “I don’t know the time frame, but my office will play coordination 
with the funeral homes because they will be inundated with people,” 
Russell said. “At some point, it will overcome their capacity, and we 
will need to work with the funeral homes to help with body storage and 
cremation.”</p>
<p> <span> <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-pandemic-chicago-illinois-news-20200612-vtsyjc7gqfgvvcj3ogkxvgkwuq-story.html#nt=interstitial-auto">[Most read] Coronavirus in Illinois updates: Here’s what’s happening Friday with COVID-19 in the Chicago area <span>»</span></a> </span> </p>
<p> While the space issue looms, funeral homes are already making 
adjustments to services during the coronavirus pandemic. Some mourners 
are attending services electronically. Others arrive to mourn in shifts 
of 10 or fewer people at a time. One Wheaton funeral home director 
called it “controlled chaos.”</p>
<p> “We don’t know how long this will go on or if we’ll run out of 
space,” said John Glueckert of Glueckert Funeral Home in Arlington 
Heights.</p>
<h1> Mobile morgues </h1>
<p> DuPage County Coroner Rich Jorgensen says the refrigerated 
semi-trailer parked outside the back entrance of his Wheaton office has 
the capacity to hold up to 50 bodies.</p>
<p> Jorgensen said he started looking for additional morgue space weeks 
ago in preparation for a wave of COVID-19 deaths. This is the first time
 DuPage has had to find such space, he said.</p>
<p> “The idea behind that is to be able to help hospitals and the 
funeral director community in handling any overflow in the number of 
deaths that may occur,” Jorgensen said. “We decided it was better to be 
prepared and have that in place, rather than try to scramble once we’re 
behind the 8-ball.”</p>
<p> <span> <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-coronavirus-cases-surge-lockdowns-20200611-d2w7lbwrcvfq3gqclfpeltrura-story.html#nt=interstitial-auto">[Most
 read] As US lockdowns roll back, there’s been an alarming rise in 
coronavirus cases. Here’s what’s driving surges in some states. <span>»</span></a> </span> </p>
<p> Kane County has similar nondescript, refrigerated trucks waiting 
outside Elgin’s Sherman Hospital and behind the coroner’s office in 
Geneva. Each truck can hold up to 24 bodies.</p>
<p> Russell and Jorgensen both plan to store any COVID-19 bodies in the mobile units to keep them separate from other deaths.</p>
<p> Kane County Coroner Rob Russell and his staff are preparing for a 
large increase in the number of deaths in the coming weeks due to 
COVID-19. <span>(Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune)</span></p>
<p> Russell said he does not want to bring any coronavirus bodies into 
the coroner’s office because the building is not equipped to handle it 
and has air circulation problems to begin with.</p>
<p> The Cook County medical examiner’s office has arranged for access to
 a 40,000-square-foot refrigerated warehouse that can store at least 
1,000 bodies, said spokeswoman Natalia Derevyanny. The office wants to 
be prepared for every possible outcome during the worldwide pandemic, 
she said.</p>
<p> “That is our surge center," Derevyanny said. “Our hope is that we’ve done all this planning and we’re not going to use it.”</p>
<p> <span> <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-live-stream-video-20191101-mmzazul6lrfspbf7d5as6ju2am-htmlstory.html#nt=interstitial-auto">[Most read] Watch live: CDPH Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady makes an announcement <span>»</span></a> </span> </p>
<p> Derevyanny would not identify the location of the warehouse but said
 it is about 5 miles from the Cook County medical examiner’s office near
 Harrison Street and Damen Avenue. It will service the county, including
 the suburbs, and is expected to be operational this week, Derevyanny 
said.</p>
<p> Like other suburban coroners, Deputy Chief Coroner Laurie Summers said Will County is not handling known COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p> “The reason for that is it is a natural death,” Summers said. “We have other cases we have to sign out.”</p>
<p> When Will County does examine bodies that may be carrying 
coronavirus, the coroner is handling the situation as if employees could
 contract the virus from the body.</p>
<p> “We’ve got to treat it that way,” Summers said.</p>
<h1> Funeral homes anticipate surge</h1>
<p> As coroners prepare to store more bodies than usual, local funeral 
homes are on the front lines preparing to store bodies for longer 
periods of time while people wait to bury their loved ones.</p>
<p> Daniel Symonds of Symonds-Madison Funeral Home in Elgin is 
encouraging families to delay burial services until the shelter-in-place
 order is over and large groups can safely gather.</p>
<p> “I’m a smaller funeral home and I have that flexibility to give to 
my families,” Symonds said. “If I was a larger home doing 300 to 400 
cases a year, I might not have that flexibility.”</p>

urn at Symonds-Madison Funeral Home on Monday, March 30, 2020 in Elgin. <span>(Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune)</span></p>
<p> The only coronavirus patient Symonds has received so far came frozen
 and double-bagged from the hospital, he said. With the family’s 
permission, he took the body straight to the crematorium.</p>
<p> Symonds said he plans to buy another cooler to help with the possible influx of bodies.</p>

<p> John Kunsch, co-owner of Naperville’s Beidelman-Kunsch Funeral Homes
 &amp; Crematory, said the funeral home right now is not getting 
back-logged, but they are preparing for families to postpone services. 
He does not believe they will run out of space.</p>
<p> “We are prepared to postpone as many as we can,” Kunsch said. “We do have the space available.”</p>
<p> Beidelman-Kunsch, which has two locations in Naperville, has had one
 family postpone a burial so far. The funeral home is also allowing 
families to bury their loves ones now, and come back for a larger 
memorial service once groups are allowed to gather again.</p>
<p> Susan Hultgren, co-owner of Hultgren Funeral Home in Wheaton, said 
they have begun taking pictures of the deceased to share with relatives 
who couldn’t attend services in person.</p>
<p> And Elgin-based Laird Family Funeral Services is offering a webcast 
option for families, said owner Steve Laird. At its main funeral home 
location in Elgin, social distancing recommendations have forced Laird 
to use only one of its three visitation rooms.</p>
<p> <span> <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-nyt-seattle-autonomous-zone-trump-20200612-lflivt3dmrc3bax7mkfiac2ofy-story.html#nt=interstitial-auto">[Most

<p> Still, holding proper memorial and burial services helps with the 
grieving process. Arranging a funeral exposes families to the power of 
grief and allows them to make the right choices for their loved one, 
Kunsch said.</p>
<p> “You can’t put the pause on grief,” Kunsch said. “Grief comes in 
waves. It comes when you’re thinking you’re OK, you’re hit with an idea,
 a song on the radio. It’s something that has to be acknowledged.”</p>
<p> Glueckert Funeral Home in Arlington Heights has hosted services for 
two coronavirus patients. John Glueckert said families have found 
creative ways to still host services from live streaming through Zoom or
 Facebook Live or video recording services for playback. Another family 
wanted to have more than 10 people at the services, so they held it in 
their house.</p>
<p> Hultgren said a major focus this week is ensuring embalmers have 
enough personal protective equipment so they can safely embalm bodies of
 coronavirus patients.</p>
<p class=""> Funeral home workers have also seen an increase in hours worked.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span> <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-jussie-smollett-double-jeopardy-hearing-20200612-blh45utwmjhdnoebvslqmxofaa-story.html#nt=interstitial-auto">[Most read] Jussie Smollett loses bid to have new case dropped on double-jeopardy grounds <span>»</span></a> </span> </p>
<p class=""> Aurora’s Daleiden Mortuary places two of its six directors 
on call for 28 days straight to work in the funeral home for day-to-day 
operations and then rotates them. If someone tests positive for 
COVID-19, Owner Anastasia Daleiden Yokosawa said only two of the six 
would need to be removed for a quarantine.</p>
<p> “It’s stressful and exhausting but it’s working, and our goal is to 
be able to keep serving these unfortunate families who have had to 
endure the experience of losing a loved one at such a horrific time,” 
she said.</p>
<p> As state officials continue to announce more deaths due to 
coronavirus daily, suburban coroners say they are not yet overwhelmed 
with deaths, and there is still capacity in the regular morgues. They 
hope their planning goes well beyond what will actually be needed.</p>
