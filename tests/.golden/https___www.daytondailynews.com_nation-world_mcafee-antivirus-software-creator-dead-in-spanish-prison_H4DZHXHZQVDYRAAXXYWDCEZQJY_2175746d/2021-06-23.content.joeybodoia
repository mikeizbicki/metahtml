<p>MADRID (AP) — John McAfee, the creator of McAfee antivirus software, 
was found dead in his jail cell near Barcelona in an apparent suicide 
Wednesday, hours after a Spanish court approved his extradition to the 
United States to face tax charges punishable by decades in prison, 
authorities said.</p>
<p>The eccentric cryptocurrency promoter and tax opponent whose history 
of legal troubles spanned from Tennessee to Central America to the 
Caribbean was discovered at the Brians 2 penitentiary in northeastern 
Spain. Security personnel tried to revive him, but the jail’s medical 
team finally certified his death, a statement from the regional Catalan 
government said.</p>
<p>"A judicial delegation has arrived to investigate the causes of 
death,” the statement said, adding that “everything points to death by 
suicide.”</p>
<p>The statement didn’t identify McAfee by name but said the dead man 
was a 75-year-old U.S. citizen awaiting extradition to his country. A 
Catalan government official familiar with the case who was not 
authorized to be named in media reports confirmed to The Associated 
Press that it was McAfee.</p>
<p>Spain’s National Court on Monday ruled in favor of extraditing 
McAfee, 75, who had argued in a hearing earlier this month that the 
charges against him by prosecutors in Tennessee were politically 
motivated and that he would spend the rest of his life in prison if 
returned to the U.S.</p>
<p>The court's ruling was made public on Wednesday and was open for 
appeal, with any final extradition order also needing to get approval 
from the Spanish Cabinet.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur was arrested last October at Barcelona’s 
international airport. A judge ordered at that time that McAfee should 
be held in jail while awaiting the outcome of extradition proceedings.</p>
<p>McAfee had been charged the same month in Tennessee with evading 
taxes after failing to report income from promoting cryptocurrencies 
while he did consulting work, made speaking engagements and sold the 
rights to his life story for a documentary. The criminal charges carried
 a prison sentence of up to 30 years.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Memphis declined to comment Wednesday.</p>
<p>Born in England's Gloucestershire in 1945 as John David McAfee, he 
started McAfee Associates in 1987 and led an eccentric life after 
selling his stake in the antivirus software company named after him in 
the early 1990s.</p>
<p>McAfee twice made long-shot runs for the U.S. presidency and was a 
participant in Libertarian Party presidential debates in 2016. He 
dabbled in yoga, ultra-light aircraft and producing herbal medications.</p>
<p>In July 2019 he was released from detention in the Dominican Republic
 after he and five others were suspected of traveling on a yacht 
carrying high-caliber weapons, ammunition and military-style gear, 
officials on the Caribbean island said at the time.</p>
<p>McAfee told Wired Magazine in 2012 that his father, a heavy drinker 
and “very unhappy man,” shot himself when McAfee was 15. “Every day I 
wake up with him,” he told Wired.</p>
<p>In an interview with British newspaper The Independent, McAfee said 
his experience of being in a Spanish prison was a “fascinating 
adventure” and he planned never to return to the U.S.</p>
<p>“I am constantly amused and sometimes moved. The graffiti alone could
 fill a thousand-page thriller,” he was quoted as saying. “A few of my 
fellow prisoners have confided in me small pieces of their lives.”</p>
<p>He also told The Independent that prisoners and guards had recognized him and some asked for his autograph.</p>
<p>McAfee said his main point of contact outside the prison was his 
wife, Janice McAfee. The last post from his Twitter account was a 
retweet of a Father’s Day message from her.</p>
<p>“These eight months John has spent in prison in Spain have been 
especially hard on his overall health both mentally and physically, as 
well as financially, but he is undeterred from continuing to speak truth
 to power,” it said.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy in Madrid didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>California chipmaker Intel, which bought McAfee's company in 2011 for
 $7.68 billion, for a time sought to dissociate the brand from its 
controversial founder by folding it into its larger cybersecurity 
division. But the rebranding was short-lived, and Intel in 2016 spun out
 the cybersecurity unit into a new company called McAfee.</p>
