<h1>Former Pres. Obama Takes Aim At Republicans Who Refuse To Debate Voting Rights Bill</h1>
<h2>The former president also called the filibuster a “tool for obstruction.”</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">Published on 6/22/2021 at 12:57 PM</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>By Kavish Harjai</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Former President Barack Obama on 
Monday criticized Senate Republicans who are expected to block a major 
voting rights and elections bill from being debated, saying it’s 
“unacceptable” that they don’t want to talk about voting. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Think about this in the 
aftermath of an insurrection, with our democracy on the line, and many 
of these same Republican senators, going along with the notion that 
somehow there were irregularities and problems with legitimacy in our 
most recent elections — they’re suddenly afraid to talk about these 
issues and figure out solutions on the floor of the Senate,” former 
President Obama said during a teleconference with former Attorney 
General Eric Holder.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>On Tuesday, Senate Majority 
Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is expected to bring the For the People Act 
to a procedural vote, which would open it up for debate. To move on to 
the debate, Senate Democrats would need to overcome the filibuster, 
which requires 60 votes of approval in the evenly divided Senate. But 
that’s an unlikely outcome. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has 
already said the For the People Act </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=C1C5D043-823E-4F3E-ACC5-67D32151FCF8"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>would get “no quarter,”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>
 called the bill a “radical proposal” that would “rig the rules of 
American elections permanently in Democrats’ favor,” and has encouraged 
Republican senators to oppose even debating the sweeping election 
reforms.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The For the People Act, which 
passed the House in March mostly along partisan lines, would mandate a 
15 consecutive-day period of early voting in federal elections, create 
automatic voter registration, and create independent commissions to 
oversee redistricting. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Though former President Obama 
said it doesn’t “address every problem,” he said the For the People Act 
could help shield the right to vote from Republicans who are attempting 
to pass restrictive voting laws in state legislatures. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It’s rare for former presidents 
to weigh in on current, political issues. This is the first time Obama 
has publicly backed the For the People Act.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p></p><figcaption><span>Former President Barack Obama and former 
Attorney General Eric Holder speak about the For the People Act on

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Since I left office, I've tried 
to make it a policy not to weigh in on the day-to-day scrum in 
Washington, but what’s happening this week is more than just a 
particular bill coming up to a vote,” the former president said. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>He added: “The issue of voting 
rights may not set off alarms for most of us but the violence that 
occurred in the U.S. Capitol on January 6, just a few months ago, should
 remind us we can’t take our democracy for granted around the world.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>According to the Brennan Center, 
legislators in 48 states have put forth nearly 400 bills that would 
restrict the right to vote. 22 such bills have already been enacted. You
 can keep track of how the bills are progressing </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-voting-bills-tracker-2021"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>here.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Obama said Republicans “feel 
threatened” by the historic number of people who voted in the 2020 
election and are thus trying to make it harder for people to vote. The 
former president also said the country’s history, including the events 
of January 6, “should remind us that democracy isn't a given.” </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Former Attorney General Holder said the U.S. is experiencing “the greatest assault on voting rights since the Jim Crow era.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The For the People Act is supported by every Democrat in the Senate </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://nowthisnews.com/politics/rep-jamaal-bowman-calls-sen-joe-manchin-the-new-mitch-mcconnell"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>with one exception:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>
 Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). However, it’s possible Sen. Manchin will vote 
Tuesday to move forward with debate on the bill.That would send a 
message to Republicans that Democrats are united — something that White 
House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration hopes to see.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“We don’t expect there to be a 
magical 10 votes,” Psaki said at a press conference on Monday. 
“Democrats, we suspect and hope, will be united in making voting more 
accessible for people across the country, making sure we’re advocating 
for it as a fundamental right.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Though Sen. Manchin is opposed to the For the People Act in its current form, he </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/manchin-memo-on-voting-legislation/7f38ab4b-3224-4dce-bf89-7e0a28d18b96/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>offered a compromise,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> which </span></span></span></span></span></span>former Georgia gubernatorial candidate<span><span><span><span><span><span> and voting rights champion </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/stacey-abrams-backs-manchin-s-compromise-voting-legislation-n1271134"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Stacey Abrams endorsed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> Obama on Monday also backed the compromise. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The expected failure of the bill 
to move forward to a debate will most likely reignite calls to end the 
filibuster, which former President Obama said has become “a tool for 
obstruction.” However, nixing the filibuster would be another uphill 
battle, as several Senate Democrats, including Sen. Manchin and Sen. 
Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), have expressed their opposition to doing so. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
