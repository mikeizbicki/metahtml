<h1>Trial of multimillionaire Robert Durst suspended over coronavirus spread</h1>

<p> The trial of accused murderer Robert Durst is one of many that are 
due to be put on hold starting Monday amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
It's part of a temporary jury-trial suspension in Los Angeles County due
 to the spread of coronavirus, CNN reported. <span>(Alex Gallardo/Associated Press)</span></p>
<p> The trial of accused murderer Robert Durst has been put on hold starting Monday amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p> “Due to concerns regarding the coronavirus/COVID-19, Judge Mark E. 
Windham has ordered that the People v. Robert Durst trial stands 
adjourned until April 6," Los Angeles Superior Court said in a statement
 Sunday.</p>
<p> It’s part of a temporary jury-trial suspension in Los Angeles County
 due to the spread of coronavirus, the court told the Daily News in a 
statement. The Court will begin scaling down operations Monday “to 
achieve social distancing in all 38 courthouses,” the statement said, 
with more public protection measures possibly on the way Monday or 
Tuesday.</p>
<p> “As the largest trial court in the nation, the Superior Court of Los
 Angeles County is methodically scaling back non-essential court 
operations as part of a phased approach,” Presiding Judge Kevin Brazile 
said in a statement. “We will continue to provide services for the most 
vulnerable in our communities and remain open to handle criminal matters
 subject to statutory deadlines.”</p>
<p> Police learned earlier Sunday that all jury trials would be suspended through at least March 30, CNN reported.</p>
<p> “Effective Monday, March 16, 2020, there will be a suspension of all
 jury trials, both those currently in progress, as well as those pending
 commencement, through March 30th,” read the memo, as Los Angeles Police
 Department spokesperson Josh Rubenstein confirmed to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/15/us/california-jury-trials-suspended/index.html">CNN</a>. “This notification applies to jury trials only.”</p>
<p> Durst, 76, is a multimillionaire charged with killing Susan Berman 
in late 2000, allegedly because she was set to incriminate him in the 
1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst, as CNN noted. 
Berman was his best friend. She was found dead in her apartment in 
Beverly Hills, and he was arrested and charged in March 2015, according 
to CNN.</p>
<p> A friend testified Thursday that McCormack foresaw her death and entreated a friend to make sure he saw justice.</p>

<p> Durst has pleaded not guilty to murdering Berman to keep her from 
telling New York authorities what she knew about his wife’s 
disappearance. His trial in Berman’s death has been under way for about a
 week.</p>
<p> As part of the scaling-down process, new jurors won’t be summoned 
for at least the next 30 days, the court said, and trial judges for any 
jury trial can either continue at a later date or declare a mistrial.</p>
