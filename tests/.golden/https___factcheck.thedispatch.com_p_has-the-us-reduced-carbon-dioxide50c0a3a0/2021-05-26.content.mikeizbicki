<p>In Wednesday’s vice presidential debate, Vice President Mike Pence <a href="https://youtu.be/t_G0ia3JOVs?t=2998">claimed</a>,
 “The United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are 
still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we’ve done it through innovation 
and we’ve done it through natural gas and fracking.”</p>
<p>The United States’ carbon emissions have steadily decreased over the past few years, with the EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/latest-inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-shows-long-term-reductions-0#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(April%2013%2C%202020),by%2027%25%20%2D%2D%20even%20as">reporting</a>
 as of the end of 2018 “national greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by
 10%” since 2005. Carbon emissions formed the vast majority of these 
greenhouse gas emissions. Using 2016, when the agreement began, as the 
baseline, it would appear that emissions have increased <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/us-ghg-inventory-2020-main-text.pdf">according to EPA data</a>,
 from 6,524 million metric tons in 2016 to 6,677 million metric tons in 
2018. However, while the EPA has not finalized data for 2019 yet, the 
International Energy Agency <a href="https://www.iea.org/articles/global-co2-emissions-in-2019">reports</a>
 that the United States’ carbon emissions decreased by 140 million 
metric tons, still higher than 2016 emissions but in keeping with the 
general downward trend of U.S. carbon emissions.</p>
<p>In terms of <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/us-leads-world-reducing-co2/">raw carbon emissions</a>
 reduction, the United States outpaces every other country in the rest 
of the world. Many countries in the Paris Agreement have seen smaller 
emission reductions or not seen their emissions decrease at all. Canada,
 <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/canada/">for example</a>,
 saw its emissions peak in 2007, then rapidly decline, but has seen a 
slow but steady increase in emissions since 2009 and has nearly returned
 to its 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions. China, <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/">too</a>, has seen its carbon emissions continue to rise. </p>
<p>But the United States is behind other countries that are party to the
 Paris Agreement when it comes to reductions as a percentage. The 
European Union, for example, is <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/greenhouse-gas-emission-trends-6/assessment-3#:~:text=The%20EU%202020%20Climate%20and,14%20%25%20reduction%20compared%20with%202005.">expected</a> to meet, if not surpass, its goal of a 20 percent decline in emissions since 1990, and has seen a continuous steady <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/eu/">decline</a>
 in carbon emissions since joining the Paris Agreement. The United 
States, on the other hand, is above its 1990 levels of greenhouse 
emissions, and since its decline in emissions began after 2007, has seen
 a decline of just under 10 percent. </p>
<p>Pence’s claim is partly correct: The United States’ carbon emissions have declined since <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/">peaking</a>
 in 2007 and the United States’ emission reduction has outpaced all of 
the countries that have remained as a part of the Paris Agreement in 
terms of raw emissions. However, many individual countries have seen 
their carbon emissions reduced at a faster rate than the United States. </p>

<p class="rm-manual"><span>As long as it continues to go down, there is no need for us to agree to the Paris Climate accord.</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>China is a part of it and it has no intention of curtailing any CO2 emissions.</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>The current top 3 polluters are China India 
and America. Which, honestly, makes the most of European CO2’s more 
irrelevant (don’t get me started on how Germany tossed its nuclear 
energy like fools and started buying more gas from their enemy, Russia).</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>We are the only one with emissions going down
 from the major polluters without government intervention. Because 
Americans on their own are making more responsible choices, and 
technology is being created to use less energy.</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>One easy example is this: most Americans have less need for a giant television. We have smartphones that we do everything on.</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Like me writing this comment to Alec Dent. I 
COULD spend the extraordinary effort to walk over to my pc across the 
room, and COULD strain my knees and back to sit down and wait for the pc
 to boot up to comment while battling that large house fly that entered 
my room....</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Or...I could continue to be lazy in my bed 
with my phone with the lights off saving electricity, under the covers 
which are warm and fuzzy from the cold October air in NJ.</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>I think I know which choice I am destined 
for. And I will follow that destiny completely. None shall stop my 
either on terra firma.</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Millennials will save the world yet. Take that you energy consuming baby boomer bisons!</span></p>

<p class="rm-manual"><span>This article seems pretty incomplete without 
accounting for changes in population. Surely that's a relevant detail 
for a number of reasons. I don't know how it changes the outcome, but 
the fact-check would be a lot more trustworthy if it were covered. I 
guess a per-capita comparison would achieve the same thing.</span></p>
