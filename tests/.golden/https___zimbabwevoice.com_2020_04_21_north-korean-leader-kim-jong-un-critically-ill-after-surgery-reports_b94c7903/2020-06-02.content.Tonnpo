<h1>North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un ‘critically ill’ after surgery: Reports</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span> 2,352 </span><span> 1 minute read</span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>April 21, 2020</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span><a href="https://zimbabwevoice.com/category/news-highlights/africa-world-news/">Africa &amp; World News</a></span> </p>
<p>NORTH Korean leader Kim Jong Un is reportedly in “grave danger” following a surgical procedure, CNN and Reuters report.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old dictator underwent a cardiovascular procedure, state media indicates.</p>
<p>The South Korean Government on Tuesday was looking into the reports. 
Officials from South Korea’s Unification Ministry and National 
Intelligence Service said they couldn’t immediately confirm the report.</p>
<p>Rumours began to swirl about Jong Un’s health after he did not attend
 an anniversary event for the birthday of its founding father and Kim’s 
grandfather, Kim Il Sun.</p>
<p>“My understanding is that he had been struggling (with cardiovascular
 problems) since last August but it worsened after repeated visits to 
Mount Paektu,” Daily NK reported.</p>
<p>Daily NK is a website based in South Korea that gathers information 
from informants inside the secretive and isolated country north of its 
border.</p>
<p>Bloomberg said the health of the North Korean leader is one of the 
state’s most closely guarded secrets, typically only known by a handful 
of people in the inner circle of leadership.</p>
<p>New Zealand-born journalist Anna Fifield, author of a book on Jong 
Un, said on Twitter his biggest risk factor was his obvious poor health,
 in particular the risk of cardiac problems.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Breaking: The US is monitoring intelligence that 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health is in grave danger following a 
surgery, a US official with direct knowledge tells me.</p>

<p>“Kim Jong Un is five feet, seven inches tall, and weighs about three 
hundred pounds = BMI of 45, or ‘extremely obese’,” she wrote.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">ALSO ON ZIMVOICE:</p>
<p class="rm-manual">North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is 'alive and well'</p>
<p class="">Three hundred pounds is the equivalent of about 136 kilograms.</p>
<p class="">“There have been a number of recent rumours about Kim’s 
health (smoking, heart, and brain). If Kim is hospitalised, it would 
explain why he wasn’t present on the important April 15th celebrations,”
 former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea Bruce Klingner told 
CNN.</p>
<p class="">“But, over the years, there have been a number of false 
health rumours about Kim Jong Un or his father. We’ll have to wait and 
see.”</p>
<p class="">Kim Jong Un is one of the world’s most mysterious men, with 
very little known about his private life and childhood — apart from a 
string of bizarre myths, such as his weather-controlling powers.</p>
<p class="">However, in her book, The Great Successor, Fifield managed to dig up some fascinating details of the leader’s personal life.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In my book "The Great Successor," I wrote that Kim 
Jong Un's biggest risk factor was his obvious poor health — and in 
particular the risk of cardiac problems. Kim Jong Un is five feet, seven
 inches tall, and weighs about three hundred pounds = BMI of 45, or 
"extremely obese" <a href="https://t.co/04EsZfuues">pic.twitter.com/04EsZfuues</a></p>

<p class="rm-manual">In an interview with Vox last year, she described him as a pampered child raised to believe his own greatness.</p>

<p class="">“He was a spoiled brat. He was brought up to believe that he
 was a demigod from the age of 3or 4, probably as long as he can 
remember. He was given a specially modified car so he could drive it 
himself at the age of 7,” she told the publication.</p>
<p class="">“Then there was the time the family’s personal sushi chef, 
who had basically been hired to be Kim’s friend, went fishing for sea 
bass with Kim and his brother.” – Agencies </p>
