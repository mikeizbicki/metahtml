<p>When the first images of a sarin gas attack streamed into the White 
House Situation Room, President Donald Trump ordered his National 
Security Council to come back to him the next day with some concrete 
options. Defense Secretary James Mattis, National Security Adviser H.R. 
McMaster and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford did just 
that; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-confronts-the-contradictions-of-his-foreign-policy-rhetoric/2017/04/07/c1a32dfe-1bc4-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_take-11am:homepage/story&amp;utm_term=.caf0a23799c3">after rounds of meetings</a>
 with national-security principles, President Trump ordered the U.S. 
Navy to launch fifty-nine cruise missiles on an Assad regime airbase 
where the gas attack originated.</p>
<p>At the same time, the NSC was putting the final touches on a North 
Korea policy review that has been an ongoing project for months. Unlike 
the administration’s deliberations on the Syrian chemical weapons 
attack, President Trump is giving his national security advisers far 
more time and a wider degree of flexibility. Before the policy review 
began, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/white-house-explores-options-including-use-of-military-force-to-counter-north-korean-threat-1488407444">the Wall Street Journal reported</a>
 in March that Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland directed 
aides to include “ideas that one official described as well outside the 
mainstream.”</p>
<p>We now know just how unconventional some of these options are: they 
apparently include everything from reintroducing nuclear weapons to 
South Korea as a show of force and deterrence to assassinating Kim 
Jong-un and his top commanders. “We have 20 years of diplomacy and 
sanctions under our belt that has failed to stop the North Korean 
program,” a senior intelligence official involved with the review <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-s-options-north-korea-include-placing-nukes-south-korea-n743571">told NBC News</a>.
 Read between the lines and it’s obvious what the overall message from 
the Trump administration is: North Korea is a problem that has been on 
Washington’s hot-plate for way too long, so it’s time to shake up the 
establishment and look for new alternatives. </p>
<p>There was a time when assassinating a foreign leader was an integral 
component of America’s national-security toolkit. During the Cold War, 
leaders who were either insufficiently supportive of U.S. policy goals 
or in bed with the Soviets were targets for removal. Cuba’s Fidel 
Castro, <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/94465.pdf">Congo’s Patrice Lumumba</a>
 the Dominican Republic's Rafael Trujillo and Guatemala's Jacobo Árbenz 
were all on the CIA’s hit-list at one point in time, and Libya’s Muammar
 el-Qaddafi was a frequent target due to his sponsorship of 
international terrorism. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan authorized an 
air strike on Qaddafi’s compound in the hope that he would be in the 
building. After three months of interviews across the national-security 
bureaucracy, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/magazine/target-qaddafi.html?pagewanted=all">the New York Times Magazine concluded</a> that “the assassination of Qaddafi was the primary goal of the Libyan bombing” in 1986.</p>
<p>The Cold War, however, has been over for twenty-five years. Killing 
foreign political officials, an option that was once always on the 
table, is now generally discouraged and frowned upon. In fact, It’s been
 U.S. policy since the Gerald Ford presidency to stay far away from 
anything that would suggest that the United States is a participant, 
involved in some way or complicit in an assassination attempt. President
 Ford’s executive order on this <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=59348">is quite clear</a>:
 “No employee of the United States Government shall engage in, or 
conspire to engage in, political assassination.” President Reagan 
restated—and some would say expanded—that restriction in <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12333.html">executive order 12333</a>,
 which says that “[n]o person employed by or acting on behalf of the 
United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, 
assassination.”</p>
<p>Pursuing a policy that would lead to the assassination of Kim Jong-un
 and the decapitating of the North Korean leadership would therefore be a
 big reversal from a U.S. policy that has persisted for forty-one years.
 Policies, of course, can change and presidential directives and 
executive orders can be modified or rewritten. And there is no statutory
 prohibition that would prohibit the president of the United States to 
order a hit on a foreign leader. Although <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1116">18 U.S. Code, Section 1116</a>
 could be used to prosecute a U.S. person who attempts to kill a foreign
 leader, this statute only applies if the crime is committed in the 
United States or the leader is targeted “in a country other than his 
own.” If President Trump were willing to amend current executive orders 
on the books, his administration would presumably target Kim Jong-un and
 not be penalized under the criminal code. </p>
<p>A question that is just as important is whether assassinating Kim or 
the generals in charge of North Korea’s nuclear program, ballistic 
missile program, military or intelligence services would be a good 
policy. We tend to believe that if we just took out the top, bad guy in 
the regime, all of the other bad guys in that regime will be scared 
straight, change their behavior and suddenly turn their governments into
 bastions of human rights and democracy. We’ve had experience with his 
belief before: several days prior to major military operations in Iraq, 
Washington <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/19/sprj.irq.main/">lobbed cruise missiles at Saddam</a>
 and the Iraqi political leadership in the belief that perhaps further 
war could be avoided. Whether that hypothesis would have played out is 
unknown because Saddam survived those attacks—it’s comfortable to assume
 that the Baa’thist leadership would surrender to coalition forces the 
next day, but it’s just as likely that the war would go on.</p>
<p>North Korea is an entirely different situation than Iraq was in 2003.
 Kim Jong-un is solidly in power, having killed or marginalized anyone 
(including his uncle and half-brother) perceived to be even a minimal 
threat to his control. Unlike Iraq, whose military was demoralized and 
degraded by the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and by a sanctions regime over 
the next decade, North Korea is a nuclear-weapons state with ballistic 
missiles that have the capability to level Seoul quickly and target U.S.
 bases in the region. Killing Kim and banking on the idea that the 
regime would change how it does business after seven decades would be a 
high price to pay if that untested theory proved to be wrong. Because 
North Korea is such a black-hole in terms of human intelligence, the 
U.S. intelligence community wouldn’t be able to confidently assess that 
the man or woman (Kim’s sister, for instance) who replaces Kim wouldn’t 
be just as vicious or unpredictable. Assassinating a head-of-state is 
the definition of an act of war, and nobody can accurately guess whether
 cooler heads in Pyongyang would prevail over those who would be itching
 to demonstrate strength through retaliation. </p>
<p>Putting Kim six feet underground is only one choice in a set of 
options that the National Security Council will present to President 
Trump for his consideration. It may even be a policy option that is so 
far outside the mainstream that Trump’s national-security aides would 
disabuse him of studying it further. Reaction from Beijing would be 
swift and unyielding, and as much as the South Korean and Japanese 
governments would like North Korea to behave more predictably, it’s not 
at all certain that Seoul and Tokyo would believe that assassinating the
 men at the top would achieve that objective.</p>
<p>One hopes that all of this talk is more of political gamesmanship to 
goad the Chinese into cooperating with the United States, and nothing 
more. </p>
