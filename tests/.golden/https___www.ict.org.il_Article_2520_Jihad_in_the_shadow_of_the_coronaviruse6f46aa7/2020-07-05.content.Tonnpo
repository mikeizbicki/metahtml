<h1> Jihad in the shadow of the coronavirus</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> 24/03/2020 | by Shay, Shaul (Dr.) </p>
<p>As the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world, some radical 
Islamic clerics believe the virus was perhaps sent by Allah because of 
the disobedience and sins of mankind. Other clerics claimed that the 
pandemic is edging the world closer to the Day of Judgement.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> </p>
<p>Some Shia clerics, find in the pandemic signs that are expected with 
the emergence of the return of the Mahdi - the Muslim savior, including 
widespread economic issues, deaths and all-round chaos.</p>
<p>Scientific studies show that conspiracy theories have a tendency to 
arise in relation to periods of crisis and uncertainty in society. These
 are the same conditions produced by virus outbreak, which explains the 
spread of conspiracy theories in relation to coronavirus.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The global coronavirus outbreak gave Islamists a new opportunity to 
spew antisemitism and conspiracy theories about their perceived enemies.
 Even though the virus has hit the United States and Israel, many 
Islamists insist on seeing a conspiracy behind everything.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>But, leaders and military commanders of terror groups are 
pre-occupied by the coronavirus crisis and the need to take care for 
their people’s health and well-being.</p>
<p>In the coronavirus’ shadow, Islamic terror group's leaders had to 
change priorities and to act on a presumption that the priority must now
 be given to the war against the coronavirus and suspend temporarily 
terror attacks. </p>
<p>Hassan Nasrallah the leader of Hezbollah said in a speech that “today
 we are facing an enemy whose threat is clear, large and wide. This 
threat does not stop at borders, but rather involves the world. We are 
in midst of a warfare, it’s a global war being fought by people and 
exposing world governments as a priority to be handled.” Nasrallah added
 that “in any battle, there’s a target and an enemy, the problem in this
 battle is that the enemy is “coronavirus” which is anonymous in all its
 aspects. Its threat has become obvious to all people.” <a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The Islamic State</p>
<p>The Islamic State lauded the spread of the deadly coronavirus in its official al-Naba newsletter. </p>
<p>The Islamic State has previously seized upon natural disasters as 
supposed proof that God is supporting them in targeting their 
adversaries, and also has used naturally occurring events in attack 
suggestions — impressing upon followers that if a natural calamity 
causes this much suffering, jihadists can bring about similar 
destruction using manmade methods.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The Islamic state noted that the coronavirus broke out in Wuhan, 
China, and that the Chinese government is repressing Uyghur Muslims. 
“The power of God strikes upon China that declared war on Islam and 
Muslims and persecuted our brothers Uyghurs.…. illnesses do not strike 
by themselves but by the command and decree of God.”<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>After the World Health Organization (WHO) announced "the global 
coronavirus pandemic", the Islamic State (IS) group has changed its 
attitude and issued instructions for how to deal with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The group's latest al-Naba newsletter highlighted “growing concern 
about the spread of the infectious virus,” adding that “this could push 
the World Health Organization into an emergency.”<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn7">[7]</a>
 The instructions published in the latest al-Naba newsletter, were 
almost identical to the rest of the world, from handwashing to avoiding 
travel to Europe.</p>
<p>The terrorist group has offered new directives for its members to follow like:<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<ul> <li>Washing their hands frequently and “cover the mouth when yawning and sneezing.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn9">[9]</a>
</li> <li>A travel advisory to avoid traveling to Europe because of the coronavirus, described it as "the land of the epidemic.”</li> <li>It advises the healthy not to enter coronavirus-stricken areas and "the afflicted should not exit from it.”<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn10">[10]</a>
</li> <li>Islamic State members should maintain their faith in God and 
"put trust in God and seek refuge in Him from illnesses.” It described 
coronavirus as a “torment sent by God on whomsoever He wills”.</li> </ul>
<p>Somalia - Al Shabaab</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health of Somalia confirmed on March 16, 2020, its 
first case of Covid-19, identifying the patient as a Somali citizen who 
returned from China. In a bid to curb the virus’s spread, the Somali 
government has announced suspension of all international flights 
arriving or leaving the country.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>The Somali government faces challenges to its authority in several 
parts of the country. Large swaths of the country are in the hands of 
the al-Qaeda-linked armed group, al-Shabaab, which has not allowed any 
information to emerge from those areas with regards to the spread of 
COVID-19.</p>
<p>Al Shabaab's leader, Abu Ubeida, announced that the group suspended 
all activities following the corona outbreak. Abu Ubeida, noted that the
 corona outbreak may affect the group and territories under its control.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>According to the infectious disease vulnerability index (IDVI) 
created by RAND, which is an indicator of a country’s ability to cope 
with the outbreak of an infectious disease, Somalia ranks the worst 
prepared country to deal with the deadly coronavirus.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn13">[13]</a>
 An outbreak of coronavirus could be catastrophic in Somalia, where 
decades of violence and lawlessness have left the country with an almost
 nonexistent health care system.</p>
<p>Hezbollah </p>
<p>Lebanon’s coronavirus outbreak is the latest crisis to hit a country 
in ongoing political turmoil, mass anti-government protests and severe 
economic crisis.</p>
<p>Iran is dealing with one of the world’s deadliest outbreaks from the 
virus but until March 13, 2020, the Iranian regime and Hezbollah ignored
 the epidemic and until then, their priorities were on military 
operations rather than the Iranian and Lebanese people’s wellbeing.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>The problem for Hezbollah became the Shia community. Many in Lebanon 
were complaining, including the Shia themselves, about the Iranian 
flights coming to Lebanon, leading to the spread of the virus, but 
Nasrallah did not explain the Iranian flights.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The first case of the coronavirus was reported in Lebanon on February
 23, 2020, when a 45-year-old woman tested positive after flying from 
the Iranian city of Qom.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Many in Lebanon believe that these flights were not only bringing 
Lebanese back to Lebanon, but also Iranians infected with the virus to 
be treated at Hezbollah’s private hospitals. The fact that the media 
were not allowed to enter the airport when these flights arrived, 
indicated that Hezbollah was hiding something, or someone.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Hezbollah's Secretary General, Hassan Nasrallah, stressed that the 
world is before a battle against an enemy called “Coronavirus” and 
everyone is held responsible to confront it, but promised that we shall 
triumph in this battle. “Responsibility vis a vis coronavirus is 
comprehensive. The virus can be defeated if everyone takes 
responsibility and plays their part,” he said. Nasrallah gave some 
instructions to the Lebanese people:<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
<ul> <li>Nasrallah said this stage needs prayers to Allah "as our most 
effective weapon in the current battle". But he urged people to pray in 
their homes and not to go to mosques and churches.</li> <li> Nasrallah 
underlined the importance of staying home (self-isolate) by Lebanese 
citizens in order to prevent the spread of the disease.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn19">[19]</a>
</li> <li>Nasrallah called on people to be transparent if they have any 
symptoms, adding that it is a religious duty to abide by the 
instructions of the health authorities.</li> <li>Nasrallah pointed to 
the need for social solidarity to prevent any imbalance in social 
security, calling on banks to act responsibly.</li> </ul>
<p>In Lebanon, the government, security forces and Hezbollah are working
 hand in hand to contain the disease. Lebanon as part of the measures 
against the virus has closed educational institutions, restaurants, 
nightclubs, pubs, cafes, exhibitions, parks, cinemas, malls and other 
gathering venues. Lebanon has also banned flights from eleven hardly hit
 countries including Iran, with critics lamenting that the decision came
 too late. Hezbollah froze all visits to Iran and imposed a quarantine 
in Syria on a group of students who were returning to Lebanon via 
Damascus airport. </p>
<p>Nasrallah said that " We are before a humanitarian battle par 
excellence. We have the Chinese experience which indicates that the 
pandemic can be contained.” He added that until the world discovers a 
cure for this pandemic, the objective must be to limit the spread of the
 virus as well as human losses.</p>
<p>The Hamas in the Gaza Strip</p>
<p>The Hamas controlled Gaza Strip is a densely populated area (more 
than 2 million people), where the coronavirus could spread very quickly 
and that could result in a humanitarian crisis. Israeli officials 
expressed fear that it is only a matter of time before the coronavirus 
reaches the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The recent relative calm on Israel's border with Gaza Strip is a 
result of Hamas leadership’s fear of the spread of the coronavirus in 
the Gaza Strip and the dependence on Israel and Egypt in dealing with 
the pandemic.</p>
<p>Hamas and the other terrorist factions in Gaza are also worried that 
in the case of any rocket attacks launched from the Gaza Strip against 
southern Israel, arson balloons, or violent clashes on the border, 
Israel would take advantage of the world's focus on the coronavirus 
outbreak to carry out massive airstrikes in Gaza, and possibly 
assassinate terrorist leaders. Hamas officials say that Hamas will 
maintain the calm with Israel and that this is not the time for clashes 
at the Gaza border.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The “Ministry of Health” in the Gaza Strip, confirmed on March 22, 
2020, the first two cases of COVID-19 in Gaza Strip. They were placed in
 quarantine upon arrival from Egypt in a field hospital in the border 
town of Rafah.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>The Hamas-controlled Health Ministry said that its central laboratory
 is fully equipped with medical professionals and equipment to test 
samples of suspected coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>The Hamas authorities have set up a temporary hospital with 30 beds 
and 8 intensive care rooms at the Rafah crossing. The hospital is 
designed to treat coronavirus patients entering the Gaza Strip through 
Egypt. The ministry said that tests conducted on 19 Palestinians who 
returned to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt 
were negative.</p>
<p>The Hamas-controlled Health Ministry announced on March 14, 2020, 
that 2,667 Palestinians are in home isolation as a precautionary measure
 to prevent the outbreak of the coronavirus in the Gaza Strip.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn22">[22]</a></p>
<p>It is in Israel’s utmost interest to ensure that the disease does not
 hit Gaza and, Israel delivered 200 coronavirus test kits to the Gaza 
Strip as part of an effort to prevent an outbreak. On March 22, 2020, 
Israel announced that all crossings into Israel from Gaza have been 
closed.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p>The Hamas government said it closed Gaza’s border crossings with 
Israel and Egypt for travel, excluding life-threatening cases that 
required medical treatment outside the Strip.</p>
<p>Hamas restricted obligatory prayers in the mosques, encouraging 
people to perform prayers at home, and it has closed women’s prayer 
rooms. Gatherings would be limited to 100 people and schools were to 
remain shut through March.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn24">[24]</a></p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned Gaza's healthcare 
system would not be able to deal with an outbreak, given that the 
hospitals are overstretched and under-sourced and would not be able to 
cope with a large number of infected patients.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn25">[25]</a> </p>
<p>Palestinian health officials expressed concern that if and when cases
 of coronavirus are detected in the Gaza Strip, local hospitals would 
not be able to cope with a large number of infected patients. The 
officials warned that if the virus reaches Gaza, thousands of 
Palestinians may try to force their way into Israel or Egypt.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn26">[26]</a> </p>
<p>The Houthi rebels in Yemen</p>
<p>Residents in Sanaa and other Houthi-held areas live in a state of 
great fear and anxiety caused by the rapid spread of the virus both 
regionally and internationally.</p>
<p>The Houthi militias have seized new coronavirus outbreak as an 
opportunity to achieve material and political gains. Mohamed Ali 
al-Houthi, a member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, tweeted on 
March 16, 2020, that the Saudi-led coalition is to blame for any spread 
of coronavirus in Yemen as the alliance has "deliberately taken no 
precautionary measures" to confront the pandemic. He added that "We, 
from now, point the Yemeni people in the direction of their actual 
killer, saying: coronavirus is made in US, and the coalition is 
responsible for any consequences," the Houthi official said.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn27">[27]</a></p>
<p>The Iran backed Houthi rebels are currently trying to project an 
image that they are keen on preserving the health and lives of Yemenis 
in their areas of control. They have taken precautionary measures on 
March 16, 2020, closing entry points between rebel-held and 
government-controlled territory around the country and the rebels also 
suspended passengers' flights in and out of Sanaa airport.</p>
<p>The Houthis suspended schools and universities in fear of the spread 
of the coronavirus. But Houthis have exploited the virus to boost 
recruitment under the pretext that joining the group’s ranks is the only
 way not to contract the disease. The militia is carrying out extensive 
recruitment campaigns among school and university students in Sanaa, 
under the pretext of saving them from getting infected by the new 
coronavirus.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn28">[28]</a></p>
<p>The Houthi militias have forced more than 1,000 Yemeni travelers into
 so-called quarantine in the al-Bayda governorate where they are being 
kept in unsanitary conditions. The Houthis claimed that they would force
 travelers into a 14-day quarantine period.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn29">[29]</a></p>
<p>The Taliban in Afghanistan</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic came as Afghanistan grapples with multiple 
crises: an increase in Taliban violence that has thrown a supposed peace
 process into turmoil and a political feud that has seen two men claim 
the presidency.</p>
<p>The US and the Taliban signed in February 2020 a deal under which all
 foreign forces are supposed to leave Afghanistan within 14 months, but 
only if the Taliban begin peace talks with the Kabul government and 
stick to various security commitments.</p>
<p>The US-Taliban deal said the Afghan government, which was not a 
signatory, should release 5,000 Taliban prisoners before "intra-Afghan" 
talks start. But President Ashraf Ghani had agreed to release 1,500 
captives with the remaining 3,500 to be freed as negotiations begin. But
 the Taliban rejected the offer and the government's release of 
prisoners did not begin.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn30">[30]</a></p>
<p>The commanders of the Taliban who control about half of the country 
are very serious about coronavirus pandemic. They enforced different 
measures to contain the pandemic:<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn31">[31]</a></p>
<ul> <li>They held gatherings to raise awareness about coronavirus and 
asked elders and local leaders to take precautions against its spread.</li> <li>They are asking all returning refugees and those coming from outside the country to get themselves checked.</li> <li>The
 Taliban has promised safe passage to international healthcare 
organizations and humanitarian workers who are fighting against the 
coronavirus.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn32">[32]</a>
</li> </ul>
<p>The Taliban have voiced concern about the coronavirus's spread in 
government prisons. It urged international organizations and agencies to
 help prevent an outbreak in prisons and also asked its jailed members 
to follow the World Health Organization guidelines to prevent the spread
 of the virus.<a href="file:///M:/Mishlash/ICT%20Staff/Lila%20Levy/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9A/Jihad%20in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20coronavirus.docx#_ftn33">[33]</a></p>
<p>Taliban have stepped up attacks on Afghan forces since the February 
29 2020 agreement, even though Afghan troops had unilaterally cut 
offensive operations, but the coronavirus has not stopped the Taliban 
from continuing fighting.</p>
<p>European Union special envoy for Afghanistan Roland Kobia called for a
 full ceasefire in view of the growing coronavirus threat. The Taliban 
should commit to a ceasefire as a way of tackling the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The corona epidemic has caused most terrorist organizations, 
including the most radical, such as the Islamic State, to adopt an 
informal unwritten understanding to maintain a de facto "coronavirus 
cease fire".</p>
<p>In the coronavirus’ shadow, all parties act on a presumption that the
 priority must now be given to the war against the coronavirus and 
neither the Hezbollah nor Hamas have the motivation to initiate 
violence, but the current cessation of violence is temporary and once 
the virus is defeated, all the terror groups will return to the violence
 and fighting. </p>
<p>Regardless of the source of the coronavirus pandemic, wild bats or 
exotic meat market in China it is now a source of inspiration for future
 bioterrorism. The coronavirus pandemic is a perfect case study to learn
 about the threats and effects of non-conventual asymmetric warfare:</p>
<ul> <li>All the countries are vulnerable for bioterrorism.</li> <li>The damage is quick and enormous (can be global).</li> <li>The responses are predictable and ineffective (at least at the phase of the outbreak of the disease).</li> </ul>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic reminding the terror groups how death by 
pandemic doesn’t distinguish between religions, ideologies and borders. 
This understanding can deter hybrid terror organizations like Hezbollah 
and Hamas from using bioterrorism but not the most radical groups like 
the Islamic state.</p>
<p> Israel has to learn carefully the lessons from the coronavirus 
pandemic (COVID-19) and to be prepared to deal with the threat of future
 bioterrorism. </p>
