<p>North Korea has finally responded to persistent rumours that leader 
Kim Jong-Un had plastic surgery to look like his revered grandfather, 
issuing an angry denial criticising "sordid" media reports.</p>
<p>Speculation that Mr Kim's resemblance to the country's founding 
leader, Kim Il-Sung, is not 100 per cent natural has been around for 
some time, though with little or no supporting evidence.</p>
<p>The rumours have been partly fed by the fact that Kim Jong-Un has 
sought to evoke memories of his grandfather in numerous ways, through 
his dress, haircut, gestures and public appearances.</p>
<p>And there is a clear physical resemblance. But Pyongyang's patience with reports of plastic surgery appears to have run out.</p>
<p>"The false report... released by enemies is a hideous criminal act 
which the party, state, army and people can never tolerate," the 
official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a commentary.</p>
<p>KCNA flatly rejected what it described as "sordid hackwork by rubbish
 media", insisting the very idea of Mr Kim - who is in his late 20s - 
undergoing plastic surgery was "unimaginable".</p>
<p>While the focus of the commentary's fury was the South Korean media, 
it seems Pyongyang's anger was triggered by a Chinese report last week 
that was widely picked up by newspapers in the South.</p>
<p>China's Shenzhen TV cited a diplomatic source who, on a private visit
 to Pyongyang, had spoken to a North Korean official who confirmed the 
plastic surgery rumours.</p>
<p>KCNA referenced the Chinese report, but saved its real vitriol for the South Korean newspapers.</p>
<p>"Those hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not expect any mercy or leniency," the report said.</p>
<p>"Time will clearly show what dear price the human scum and media in 
the service of traitors of South Korea, slaves of capital, will have to 
pay."</p>
<p>Kim Il-Sung, who died in 1994, still inspires quasi-religious devotion among many North Koreans.</p>
<p>He is officially referred to as the Great Leader and is designated in
 the constitution as the country's Eternal President. His birthday is a 
public holiday.</p>
<p>Possibly concerned that the Shenzhen TV report may have caused 
offence, China's official Xinhua news agency issued a report, citing two
 of its correspondents in Pyongyang who rejected the plastic surgery 
rumours.</p>
<p>China was embarrassed in November when the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-27/china-falls-for-27sexiest27-kim-jong-un-award/4395742">treated as genuine a spoof article by the satirical US website The Onion</a> anointing Kim Jong-Un as "Sexiest Man Alive" for 2012.</p>
