<p>Location: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is believed to be staying

<p>About his leadership:</p>
<p>There is also speculation that Kim's absence is a sign of instability in his leadership. </p>
<p>About the Korean Peninsula:</p>
<p>In South Korea, the US and Japan, quite a number of people hold that 
the Korean Peninsula won't witness a dramatic turnaround until 
subversive political changes take place in North Korea. Such a point of 
view has fueled varied rumors and haunted North Korean politics for a 
long time. </p>

<p>Zhang Liangui, an expert on North Korea at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee</p>
<p>Speculations on why North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un has not 
appeared in public for over a month are fuelled as the country reveals 
relatively less information to the outside world. None of these 
speculations have yet been proven to be true or false. It is still too 
early to draw any conclusions as we do not have enough first-hand 
information at this time. </p>

<p class="rm-manual"><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/885239.shtml">GT editorial: Tough task to crack Pyongyang's isolation</a> </p>
<p>Here we try to analyze the realistic options of Pyongyang. To begin 
with, North Korea must make a change, which is not only a result of the 
heightened pressure it faces, but also the judgment of its young 
leadership. The backwardness of North Korea will to some extent convert 
into political pressure. <span>Boosting economic and societal development is the only path for Pyongyang.</span>
 Given the risks that will accompany development, the North Korean 
leadership must get a grip over the transformation process ahead of the 
time when it embarks on large-scale changes. </p>
<p>There will be many concerns about "opening-up" in Pyongyang. However,
 the closed-door policy has been proven wrong in history. If North Korea
 wants to develop, it has to emerge into the current of globalization. </p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/885023.shtml">GT editorial: Speculation over NK's future may be rash</a> </p>
<p>Noticeably, under the current state system, <span>it's more difficult for Pyongyang to mend fences with South Korea, Japan and the US than to develop relations with Beijing.</span>
 The key divergence between North Korea and China lies in the nuclear 
issue, but there are multiple conflicts among North Korea, South Korea, 
Japan and the US. South Korea aims at dictating the unification process 
of the Korean Peninsula, while the US longs for a revamp to North 
Korea's system, which is unacceptable to Pyongyang. </p>
