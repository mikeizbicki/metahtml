<p>In this March 4, 2020, photo, Miriam Bago uses hand sanitizer before 
eating lunch at Little Havana Activities and Nutrition Centers of Dade 
County, Inc., in Miami. The new coronavirus is posing a special 
challenge for nursing homes and other facilities that provide care for 
the elderly.</p>
<p><span> <span>AP Photo/Brynn Anderson</span> </span> </p>
<p><span>The Center for Disease Control is recommending people over the 
age of 60 to stock up on supplies and stay home should the coronavirus 
break out in their communities.</span></p>
<p><span>The guidance from the CDC came on Sunday as governments around 
the world are trying to tackle the outbreak, which has killed more than 
3,000 people worldwide. The CDC and the U.S. State Department also urged
 people not to travel on cruise ships.</span></p>
<p><span>The challenge for Kerrville is that there are more than 7,700 
people that fall into the age demographic — about 31% of the population,
 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</span></p>
<p><span>Amy Espinoza, director of nursing at Alpine Terrace in Kerrville, said the facility is taking the CDC recommendations seriously.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’ve had to cut our visiting hours down, so we can only have visitors at certain, limited times,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Espinoza, all visitors, including the facility’s vendors, are subject to a questionnaire upon entry.</span></p>
<p><span>“We ask them, ‘Have they gone out of the country recently? Have
 they traveled recently? Have they had a sneeze or a cough recently?’ 
and if any of that is noted, we have the right to say they cannot enter 
the building,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span>She added that Alpine Terrace is using all the screening tools 
at its disposal to protect the health and wellbeing of its residents.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re ensuring audits are done, that hands are being washed 
and that we are checking on residents more,” Espinoza said. “We’re not 
taking any chances.”</span></p>
<p><span>Alison Stevens, a licensed practical nurse at Villagio of 
Kerrville, a senior living facility with a memory care focus, said her 
facility is similarly monitoring visitors.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’ve asked them not to come in with shortness of breath, 
coughing and fever, and we’re making sure they use hand sanitizer before
 they come in,” she said. “We’ve provided hand sanitizer out in the 
foyer for all visitors.”</span></p>
<p><span>Over at Emerald Cottages of Kerrville, elderly residents are 
largely independent and spend more time in the community, requiring a 
different approach.</span></p>
<p><span>Community Director Kierin Johnson said the retirement community
 is closely monitoring the situation and listening to the advice of the 
city of Kerrville and local health officials.</span></p>
<p><span>For residents’ peace of mind, Emerald Cottages of Kerrville 
will soon be hosting an infectious diseases specialist from Peterson 
Health to speak to all interested residents on the subject of 
transmission and protection from infectious disease, she said.</span></p>
<p><span>“Because residents are independent and can make their own 
decisions, we offer them education through those who are in the know,” 
Johnson said.</span></p>
<p><span>Precautions also are being taken at Waterside Nursing and 
Rehab, 1213 Water St. Hand sanitizer is available for people entering 
the building. People who have body aches, fevers or coughing are advised
 not to enter.</span></p>
<p><span>“We are asking them to refrain from entering the building for 
the safety of our patients,” said Ruben Lillge, marketing director at 
Waterside.</span></p>
<p><span>Lillge said these precautions are always in effect — they didn’t begin with the COVID-19 outbreak, he said.</span></p>
<p><span>“Any type of illness can affect our elderly, and we want to prevent that,” Lillge said.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Hill Country Memorial Hospital in Fredericksburg, 
COVID-19 symptoms are the same as for other viral conditions: fever, 
cough, shortness of breath, and possibly some gastrointestinal 
discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span>“Recommended treatments are the same as for any viral illness, 
including rest, increased fluid intake, and oxygen if indicated,” states
 a press release from the hospital. “The duration is usually several 
days of mild illness. According to preliminary data, this virus does not
 seem to adversely affect the young. Most caution is directed to older 
individuals who have other disease states.”</span></p>
<p><span>Those suspected of having the virus should be isolated to prevent its spread, according to the release.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the specific guidance from the CDC:</span></p>
<p><span>During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, these groups 
should stay home as much as possible: older adults and people who have 
serious chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes or lung 
disease.</span></p>
<p><span>If a COVID-19 outbreak happens in your community, it could last
 for a long time. (An outbreak is when a large number of people suddenly
 get sick.) Depending on how severe the outbreak is, public health 
officials may recommend community actions to reduce people’s risk of 
being exposed to COVID-19. These actions can slow the spread and reduce 
the impact of disease.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 
because of your age or because you have a serious long-term health 
problem, it is extra important for you to take actions to reduce your 
risk of getting sick with the disease.</span></p>
<p><span>The CDC recommendations are the following:</span></p>
<p><span>Stock up on supplies.</span></p>
<p><span>Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others.</span></p>
<p><span>When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often.</span></p>
<p><span>Avoid crowds as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>There was some good news on Monday from China when officials at
 the World Health Organization said that of about 80,000 people who have
 been sickened by COVID-19 there, more than 70% have recovered and been 
discharged from hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span>Patients are typically released when they test negative twice 
for the virus within 24 hours, meaning they’re no longer carrying the 
virus, although some countries may be using a slightly different 
definition, which may include when people have no more respiratory 
symptoms or a clear CT scan.</span></p>
<p><span>The World Health Organization said it could take considerably 
longer for people to be “recovered,” depending on the severity of the 
disease.</span></p>
<p><span>Dr. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergency chief,
 said it can take up to six weeks for people to fully recover from 
COVID-19 infections, which could include pneumonia and other respiratory
 problems in serious cases. He said the numbers of reported patients 
have not always been systematically provided to the World Health 
Organization although the U.N. health agency is asking every country 
with cases for further information.</span></p>
