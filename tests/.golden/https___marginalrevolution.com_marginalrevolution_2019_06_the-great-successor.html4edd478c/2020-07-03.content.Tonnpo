<p class="rm-manual"> by <span><a href="file:///about">Tyler Cowen</a></span> June 17, 2019 at 2:33 pm in </p>
<p>The author is Ana Fifield, and the subtitle is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Successor-Divinely-Perfect-Brilliant/dp/1541742486/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=great+successor&amp;qid=156/marginalrevol-20" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Divinely Perfect Destiny of Brilliant Comrade Kim Jong Un</a>.
 I’ve never read a book that has so much actual information about Kim, 
most of all about his early time in Switzerland. Or how about this?:</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un’s efforts to clamp down on illegal drugs did not work.</p>
<p>At the time he left North Korea, Mr. Kang estimated that about 80 
percent of the adults in Hoeryong were using ice [meth], consuming 
almost two pounds of the highly potent drug every single day…</p>
<p>For many North Koreans, taking meth became an essential part of daily
 life, a way ot ease the grinding boredom and deprivations of their 
existence. For that reason, drugs can never be eradicated, he said.</p>
<p>Men are not allowed to have long hair, the concentration camps are 
reputed to be worse than those of the Nazis, and there is a detailed 
account of the rise of the “new rich” class in Pyongyang. Plastic 
surgery has arrived as well.</p>
<p>Definitely recommended, the book also serves up the inside story on 
the Dennis Rodman visit to North Korea. By the way, Kim hates the 
showiness of the Harlem Globetrotters.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">I read the BBC book by two British reporters about 
N. Korea, and saw the Youtube video and photos from a Swiss tourist who 
was unsupervised in a train trip across the country, as well as surveyed
 the country with Google Earth, and I concluded, aside from perhaps the 
concentration camps, which I have no knowledge of, North Korea is not 
that much different than Cuba. When I visited Cuba illegally over 20 
years ago, I thought I would see people dying in the streets, but, aside
 from universal poverty, it wasn't that bad. I bet in the N. Korean 
countryside people have small plots of land like in the USSR that they 
grow a good percentage of their food from. Obviously the rentier class 
in the capital get the lions share of spoils, true however of the USA as
 well. The only thing of interest to me about North Korea is their 
ability, like Pakistan, to build the Bomb. When and if it becomes 
intercontinental, or even before, the US should assassinate Kim. Not 
even controversial, just ask John Bolton privately.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Bonus trivia: based on nominal GDP, the only metric
 that matters (PPP? Pfft!), North Korea's economy is about one-tenth the
 size of the greater Washington, DC area. It's possibly smaller than 
just Fairfax county, VA. Upper Volta with missiles...</p>

<p class="rm-manual">"...North Korea is not that much different than Cuba. "</p>
<p class="rm-manual">That's ridiculous Ray. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Around 5% of North Koreans starved to death in the late 1990's.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_famine</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"The exact number of deaths during the acute phase 
of the crisis, from 1994 to 1998, will probably never be fully 
determined, since the government has refused to release any of this 
information to the outside world. Independent analysis estimates that 
between 800,000 and 1,500,000 people died due to starvation, disease, or
 sickness caused by lack of food."</p>

<p class="rm-manual">@RatInPutinsMaze - thanks, but your numbers are too
 high I think. From Wikipedia, see below, the numbers seem smaller. And 
I'm sure somebody in Miami would claim in Cuba many people have starved 
to death...</p>
<p class="rm-manual">(Wikipedia): out of a total population of 
approximately 22 million, somewhere between 240,000 and 3,500,000 North 
Koreans died from starvation or hunger-related illnesses, with the 
deaths peaking in 1997.[7][8] A 2011 U.S. Census Bureau report estimated
 the number of excess deaths from 1993 to 2000 to be between 500,000 and
 600,000.[9]" note at the lower bound 240k/22M = 1.1% over 4 years, or 
0.27% extra deaths a year.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Bonus trivia: I bought, in an old bookstore, the 
tome by Beatrice and Sydney Webb, "Soviet Communism: A New 
Civilization?" (1935). In a subsequent edition they dropped the question
 mark from the title.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">So only as low as 1.1% of the population starved to death in a 4 year period? </p>
<p class="rm-manual">I'll stick with my stand that North Korea was significantly worse than Cuba.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Your ideas about Cuba seem highly speculative. Have
 you been there recently? This guy has: 
http://global-training-report.com/drysdale_cuba_3-18-2019.htm</p>
<p class="rm-manual">(I have mentioned it before, whenever the topic of 
how awful Cuba must surely be, according to people how know about it 
from wikipedia or American newspapers, comes up.)</p>
<p class="rm-manual">True, Cubans don't have the most excellent 2nd 
Amendment by which they could overthrow tyranny and create a People's 
Paradise such as North Americans enjoy every day, for example their 
rights to rob convenience stores and shoplift at Walmart. Nevertheless, 
Cubans seem to have some benefits that many North Americans lack. "Prior
 Approval" will no doubt have some links and insights to contribute.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Personally I exercise my option to live in none of 
the above mentioned countries (PRK, Cuba, USA) so my comments are merely
 academic.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Per those of my relatives that remained on the 
island until the start of this decade, it's pretty craptastic unless 
you're A) connected to the upper echelons or B) have a solid association
 with the tourist trade. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Beyond that, the low "street-crime" rate and the 
generally still oppressive political atmosphere go hand in hand. 
Deviancy is generally frowned upon by the authorities, and mugging 
people is as deviant as anything. Squish!</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Functional addiction has long been an aspect of US 
life. The per worker consumption of alcohol during late 1800's railroad 
construction was insane - you'd wonder how anyone was awake enough to 
lay straight track.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">I know of small shops and factories that hire 
functional addicts. If they get hurt on the job, the employer can evade 
responsibility even here in Cuomo's People's Republic. Just tell them to
 take a blood test for their workers' comp claim. They just mumble 
complaints and show up for work all bandaged. Give them reduced pay for 
walking wounded work - the trick is to keep them showing up. The 
challenge is to always have them circling the drain.</p>
