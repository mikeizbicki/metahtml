<p>On a global scale, China is not a clearly revisionist power. But 
Beijing wants to reclaim something of its historical centrality in East 
Asia. The United States has emphasised that it intends to remain an East
 Asian power.</p>
<p>The strategic challenge for China is therefore how to shift the US 
from the very centre of the East Asian strategic equation and occupy 
that space, but without provoking responses from the US and Japan that 
could jeopardise Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule. For the US the 
strategic challenge is how to accommodate China, while reassuring 
friends and allies that it intends to hold its position without 
stumbling into conflict.</p>
<p>The South China Sea (SCS) is not the only issue in US-China 
relations; it is perhaps not even the most important issue in their 
relationship. But the SCS is today the issue where the parameters of 
US-China competition and their interests are most clearly defined. Like 
it or not, the region will draw conclusions about American resolve and 
Chinese intentions from the SCS issue, which will also shape perceptions
 of Asean.</p>
<p>It would be tedious to recount every instance of China's use of force
 or unilateral assertions of sovereignty backed by the threat of force 
in the SCS. In 2012, China established Sansha City under Hainan 
Province, with jurisdiction over the disputed Paracels and Spratly 
Islands as well as Macclesfield Bank. The following year, it promulgated
 the Hainan Fishing Regulations, which were an assertion of domestic law
 over contested areas. China has since become more aggressive in 
enforcing what it considers its domestic rights in the SCS.</p>
<p>Since 2013, China has begun an ambitious programme of land 
reclamation in the SCS, has constructed various kinds of structures on 
the new artificial islands and deployed military assets on some of them.
 China has argued that it was not the first to reclaim land or deploy 
military assets in the SCS. This may be true but is irrelevant.</p>
<figcaption>Chinese soldiers standing guard on the Spratly Islands on 
Feb 10. The very insignificance of the South China Sea territories may 
well be part of their attraction to Beijing for navigating economic 
reforms and managing social and labour unrest at a time of moderating 
growth and slower growth in future. PHOTO: REUTERS</figcaption><p>The 
speed and scope of China's reclamation dwarf anything any other claimant
 has done and the actions of a major power will always convey a 
different signature than those of small countries. China's argument that
 the infrastructure it has built is a common good for the benefit of all
 users of the SCS hardly seems intended to be believed.</p>
<p>China continues to engage Asean on a code of conduct (COC) for the 
SCS but in a barely convincing way. Progress has been glacial and 
Chinese diplomats often hold discussions on the COC hostage to Asean 
refraining from taking positions on the SCS that displease China. On 
occasion, Chinese diplomats even seem to have perversely gone out of 
their way to accentuate rather than assuage anxieties.</p>
<p>Once, after our Prime Minister spoke on the SCS at an Asean Summit, a
 senior Chinese diplomat told one of my younger colleagues that "silence
 is golden". If he meant to suggest that we were not entitled to a view 
on an important issue that affects our interests, he only undermined the
 credibility of China's claim to "peaceful development".</p>
<p>This was not an isolated incident nor has Singapore been particularly
 singled out. China routinely attempts to pressure Asean members, with 
varying degrees of success, not to raise the SCS in Asean-led forums or 
not to support other countries which do so.</p>
<p>DIPLOMACY, CHINESE STYLE </p>
<p>The general attitude that such attempts illustrate is not confined to
 the SCS issue but sometimes is on display even in seemingly trivial 
matters. Some years before I retired, one of my counterparts from an 
Asean country that was then holding the Asean chair told me that the 
Chinese ambassador to his country had forced him to shift an Asean 
leader attending a summit out of a hotel that had already been allocated
 to that Asean delegation so that then Premier Wen Jiabao could stay 
there. The ambassador insisted on this although the hotel allocated to 
Premier Wen was of equal quality. Did Premier Wen know where he was 
staying?</p>
<p>Would he have cared if he had known? But the episode certainly left a
 deep impression on my counterpart and no doubt on the Asean delegation 
that was forced to move as well.</p>
<p>Chinese diplomats often profess bewilderment that China's generosity 
towards Asean has not evoked gratitude or assuaged mistrust, and they 
pretend to ascribe this to malignant external influences. I do not think
 that Chinese diplomats are more inept or disingenuous than the 
diplomats of other countries. Their behaviour is, I think, better 
understood as illustrating the passive-aggressive style and the positing
 of false dilemmas to force acceptance of China's inherent superiority 
as the natural normative order of East Asian international relations - 
or at least South-east Asian international relations because I doubt 
that Japan will ever accept the Chinese notion of regional order 
characteristic of Chinese diplomacy.</p>
<p>Chinese diplomacy constantly hammers home the idea that if bilateral 
ties or Asean-China relations suffer because Asean stubbornly insists on
 speaking up on the SCS even when our mouths are stuffed with delicious 
Chinese cake, or because the Chinese Premier has to stay in one hotel 
rather than another, or if some date they propose for a meeting cannot 
be agreed on because it is inconvenient for Asean, it is our fault and 
ours alone.</p>
<p>China does not merely want consideration of its interests. China 
expects deference to its interests to be internalised by Asean members 
as a mode of thought; as not just a correct calculation of Asean 
interests vis-a-vis China but "correct thinking: which leads to "correct
 behaviour". Foreign policy calculations are subject to continual 
revision; correct thinking is a permanent part of the sub-conscious. 
This differentiates Chinese diplomacy from the diplomacy of other major 
powers and represents a melding of Westphalian diplomatic practice with 
ancient Chinese statecraft.</p>
<p>The very triviality of the behaviour China sometimes tries to impose 
underscores the cast of mind it seeks to embed in Asean through an 
almost Pavlovian process of conditioning. It does not always work. It 
can be counterproductive. But it works often enough and well enough with
 at least some Asean members for China to persist.</p>
<p>ASEAN PUSHES BACK </p>
<p>Asean has begun to push back against China's assertiveness. Some 
Asean claimants, including Vietnam, have moved closer to the US and 
Japan to balance China. At its last summit with Asean, two out of three 
of China's proposals - the cookies that China regularly doles out at 
such events - failed to gain acceptance and one was accepted only after a
 delay. Indonesia, a non-claimant state, has expressed concern over the 
impact of China's claims on its exclusive economic zone in the Natunas 
and signalled its intention to deploy some of its most advanced military
 assets there. But whatever their concerns, there is a limit to which an
 Asean member can tilt towards the US.</p>
<p>No one can ignore or shun China. Vietnam is the prime example. Quite 
apart from the SCS disputes, Vietnam has a long and troubled history 
with China, but a senior Vietnamese official once told me: "Every 
Vietnamese leader must be able to stand up to China and get along with 
China. If anyone thinks this cannot be done at the same time, he doesn't
 deserve to be a leader." That China and Vietnam are two out of only 
five remaining communist systems is an additional link.</p>
<p>The current muddle in Malaysia over whether or not Chinese vessels 
had intruded into its waters - one minister said yes, but another 
contradicted him - perhaps illustrates the multiple and contradictory 
forces at play in Asean. In any case, whatever costs in relations with 
Asean that China may have to pay for its assertiveness in the SCS may 
not be considered unbearably high by Beijing as compared to the 
interests at stake.</p>
<p>CORE INTEREST: SHORING UP CCP'S LEGITIMACY </p>
<p>What are those interests? I doubt that control over resources of any 
kind figures very prominently in China's calculations on the SCS. 
Resources could be shared without prejudice to claims of sovereignty as 
China has itself suggested, although its own actions do not make any 
such agreement likely in the immediate future.</p>
<p>We can dismiss too the possibility that China is trying to strengthen
 its legal case. China does not even acknowledge that many areas 
contested by Asean claimants are in dispute. In his Singapore lecture, 
President Xi Jinping categorically asserted that "the South China Sea 
islands have been China's territory since ancient times". Uncertainty 
over what China's "nine-dash line" signifies has added to regional and 
international concerns. But China has said that it will not recognise 
the decisions of the arbitral tribunal on the case the Philippines 
brought against it under Unclos (United Nations Convention on the Law of
 the Sea), even though that would at least clarify the legal status of 
the "nine-dash line". Chinese diplomats have on occasion even argued 
that it is not in Asean's interest that China should clarify its claims.</p>
<p>I do not think that China considers the SCS disputes a legal matter, 
although it has on occasion employed the vocabulary of international law
 in support of its position. But that is not the same thing as 
recognising a legal dispute and it has not been consistent in doing so. 
As I pointed out in the last lecture, China has recently relied more on 
history to justify its claims.</p>
<p>Military planners must prepare for all contingencies but I doubt that
 China's actions in the SCS are primarily intended to gain military 
advantage vis-a-vis the US. In the event of a war with the US, the 
artificial islands and the military assets on them will be vaporised 
within minutes and will not affect the outcome in any significant way. 
In any case, as I argued in my last lecture, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/war-is-unlikely-but-distrust-runs-deep">war between the US and China is highly improbable</a>.
 Beijing has carefully kept each of its actions in the SCS below a 
threshold that would compel even the most reluctant of US 
administrations to respond kinetically. The US has made clear that while
 its alliance with Japan covers disputed islands in the East China Sea, 
the same does not apply to its alliance with the Philippines and 
disputed territories in the SCS. War in support of America's principal 
East Asian ally, Japan, is credible even if unlikely; war over tiny 
islands, reefs and atolls would be absurd.</p>
<p>Even in scenarios short of war, I doubt that China really considers 
the deployment of military assets on these artificial islands a serious 
deterrent to freedom of navigation operations of the kind the US 
conducted last year and earlier this year. The US may become a little 
more cautious - it has never been reckless - but it will not stop 
operating in the SCS. Military assets that are unlikely to be used are 
at best a weak deterrent. If, for example, the People's Liberation Army 
sinks a US naval vessel or shoots down a US military aircraft, the US 
will certainly retaliate. This will confront the Chinese leadership with
 a very invidious choice: a token or ineffectual response will expose 
the hollowness of the CCP's legitimating narrative of having led the 
"Great Rejuvenation" of China, which will at least complicate, if not 
jeopardise, the CCP's hold on power; but escalation risks being forced 
to follow the highly jingoistic Chinese public opinion the CCP has 
cultivated down a path that Beijing does not really want to travel 
because it leads to the same outcome as the first choice. The Chinese 
leadership will strenuously avoid being placed in such a situation.</p>
<p>China's use of history to legitimise CCP rule and justify sovereignty
 claims gets us, I think, to the crux of the matter. For the past 
century, the legitimacy of any Chinese government has depended on its 
ability to defend China's sovereignty and preserve its borders. But what
 are those borders? Can the CCP meekly accept the borders imposed on a 
weak China that has now, to use Mao Zedong's phrase, "stood up" under 
communist leadership? China is not reckless but the CCP must at least 
give the appearance of recovering lost territory. Revanchism is an 
intrinsic part of the story of China's "Great Rejuvenation".</p>
<p>The lands lost to a weak China include what are now parts of Siberia 
and the Russian Far East, Mongolia, Hong Kong and Macau, and Taiwan, as 
well as the Paracels and Spratlys in the SCS. Siberia and the Russian 
Far East and Mongolia are now beyond recovery. Hong Kong and Macau 
reverted to Beijing's rule almost 30 years ago. The US has made clear it
 will not support independence for Taiwan. Without US support, 
independence is impossible. With that core concern assuaged, Beijing can
 multiply the economic threads binding Taiwan to the mainland and bide 
its time, confident that irrespective of internal changes and how the 
people of Taiwan regard themselves, Taiwan's long-term trajectory cannot
 run counter to China's interest. Changing the status quo is not an 
immediate possibility but is no longer an urgent issue, although China 
still eyes Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party distrustfully and will 
never entirely forgo the option of forceful reunification.</p>
<p>That leaves the SCS territories to put some credible shreds of meat 
on the bare bones of the CCP's version of history as it navigates a 
second and more difficult phase of reforms and tries to manage social 
and labour unrest at a time of moderating growth and a future when 
slower growth will be China's "new normal". The very insignificance of 
the territories in dispute in the SCS may well be part of their 
attraction to Beijing for this essentially domestic political purpose.</p>
<p>The costs and consequences of chest-thumping and acting tough in the 
SCS are minimal. Deterrence or its lack works both ways. If the Chinese 
cannot deter the US from operating in the SCS because the risks of doing
 so are too high to be credible, by the same token, neither can the US 
deter or reverse Chinese activities in the SCS. China is not going to 
dig up the artificial islands it has constructed and throw the sand back
 into the sea or give up what it says was Chinese territory since 
"ancient times". Critical statements by the US, Europe or other 
countries from around the world calling on China to respect 
international law - even Botswana has issued a statement on the SCS - 
can be brushed aside. On the SCS, the only opinion that really matters 
to the CCP is that of its own people. In the SCS, the CCP can declare 
victory without taking unacceptable risks.</p>
<p>It was also no accident that the deployment of surface-to-air 
missiles on Woody Island in the Paracels was revealed shortly after the 
conclusion of the US-Asean Sunnylands Summit. While the artificial 
islands are inconsequential in military terms, they are a potent 
reminder to Asean that China is a geographic fact, whereas the US 
presence in the SCS is the consequence of a geopolitical calculation. 
This is an idea that China never tires of seeding in ways subtle or 
direct.</p>
<p>The implications of this idea should not be exaggerated; nor can they
 be shrugged off as entirely invalid either. Until relatively recently, 
the US took a somewhat hands-off approach to disputes in the SCS. When 
China first clashed with Asean over Mischief Reef in 1995, it took some 
persuading to get the US to declare a position of principle. Moreover, 
it is, I think, a geopolitical calculation that, despite all the media 
hullabaloo and tough talk including by the President himself, engages no
 US interest that is fundamentally irreconcilable with Chinese 
interests.</p>
<p>American and Chinese interests are not symmetrical. The SCS is more 
important to China than to the US. If I am correct that the SCS issue is
 ultimately connected to the legitimacy of CCP rule, it is an 
existential issue for China; a "core interest", although China now 
denies it has applied that term to the SCS, no doubt in order to avoid 
unduly exciting us natives.</p>
<p>The US takes no position on the merits of the various claims of 
sovereignty but defines its interests in terms of upholding 
international law and freedom of navigation (FON). These are important 
interests but not on the same level as the basic underlying Chinese 
interest. FON and the integrity of international law are certainly not 
existential interests threatening the survival of the American system. I
 doubt that they are even interests that the US must defend at all 
costs.</p>
<p>LIVING WITH CHINA </p>
<p>Modern South-east Asian history can be understood as a quest for 
autonomy in which process the formation of Asean was a crucial step. But
 so can modern Chinese history also be understood as a search to restore
 the autonomy lost in the 19th century and early 20th century. Asean and
 China have no choice but to live with each other. We are not enemies, 
but relations between big and small neighbours cannot but be uneasy. 
Where the balance of autonomies will be eventually struck between Asean 
and China is the central issue in the relationship that will in turn 
determine the extent to which the regional architecture remains open and
 inclusive.</p>
<p>This is one aspect of the uncertainty and ambiguity that my first 
lecture argued are the most salient characteristics of the post-Cold War
 world. To reach and maintain an acceptable balance requires Asean to 
meet what I described in that lecture as the basic strategic challenge 
of our times: avoiding being forced into invidious choices and keeping 
open the maximum range of options.</p>
