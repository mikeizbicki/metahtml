<h1 class="rm-manual">For Donald Trump to Succeed With North Korea, He’ll Need a Pragmatic Definition of “Denuclearization”</h1>

<p>The summit on Friday between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and 
North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un was about far, far more than North 
Korea’s nuclear weapons program. The “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/korea-summit-panmunjom-declaration-full-read-kim-jong-un-north-south-moon-jae-in-a8325181.html">Panmunjom Declaration</a>” they released at the meeting’s conclusion has 21 paragraphs; just one of them addresses the nuclear issue.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Moon and Kim affirmed their intention to finally 
end the Korean War – which began in 1950 and, formally speaking, was 
only suspended by an armistice in 1953 — and “establish a permanent and 
solid peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.” Their statement laid out 
steps they plan to take to heal the scars inflicted by Korea’s bitterly 
tragic history. All of this will be done based on “the principle of 
determining the destiny of the Korean nation on their own accord” – 
something that would manage to simultaneously perturb the United States,
 Japan, and China, each of which has brutalized the Koreas for their own
 ends.</p>
<p>Seen from the U.S., however, the nuclear issue is the only thing that
 matters. And according to the declaration, “South and North Korea 
confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete 
denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.”</p>
<p>So with a historic summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump
 imminent, the question now is what “denuclearization” means, most 
importantly to Trump himself.</p>
<p>Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have 
given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have 
given up nothing. Wow, we haven’t given up anything &amp; they have 
agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, &amp; no 
more testing!</p>
<p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/988037292932653056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2018</a></p>
<p>At one end of the spectrum is Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton, who before his appointment <a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/2018/03/john-bolton-kim-trying-to-buy-time-to-complete-nuke-program/#jBgXhCBLQ7FvL5Yi.99">said</a>
 the only thing for the U.S. to discuss with Kim was “what ports should 
American freighters sail into and what air bases should American cargo 
planes land at so that we can dismantle your nuclear weapons program, 
put it in those planes and boats and sail it back to America to put it 
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.”</p>
<p>That is a clear, commonsense definition of denuclearization. It also 
would be a catastrophic stance for Trump to take, given that there’s 
absolutely no chance that North Korea would agree to it. That is part of
 its appeal to Bolton, who is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/03/north-korea-nuclear-trump-john-bolton/">itching</a> for the U.S. to start a gigantic war with North Korea.</p>
<p>The good news is the Trump administration as a whole has not ruled 
out a definition of “denuclearization” that would be achievable and 
defuse tensions between the U.S. and North Korea.</p>
<p>On April 23, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-kim-north-korea-dnuclearization/4360855.html">told reporters</a>
 that the word means “that North Korea doesn’t have or isn’t testing 
nuclear missiles,” something which is a fairly practical goal in the 
near-term.</p>
<p>When Sanders was pressed by reporters later the same day to endorse 
something like the Bolton perspective, she refused to do so, and left 
Trump maximum wiggle room for the summit. “Certainly the goal is 
denuclearization of the peninsula,” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-04218/">she said</a>.
 “I’d refer you back to also South Korean President Moon, who has said 
that North Korea has expressed a will for complete denuclearization. And
 certainly that’s the focus of any conversation and negotiation that the
 United States will have with North Korea.”</p>
<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/17/politics/mike-pompeo-kim-jong-un-visit/index.html">secretly met with Kim Jong-un</a> — also <a href="https://twitter.com/schwarz/status/988488010365849601">offered some</a>
 nuance during his recent confirmation hearings. Colorado’s Republican 
Sen. Cory Gardener tried to pin Pompeo down, asking him: “To be clear, 
again, the only goal the United States has as it relates to North Korea 
is the complete, verifiable, irreversible, denuclearization of North 
Korea?”</p>
<p>“I want to be careful about complete,” Pompeo replied. “North Korea 
also has a significant military arsenal. One of the largest armies in 
the world. We need to insure we continue to provide a strategic defense 
framework for our allies in the region, the South Koreans, and others as
 well. But the purpose of the meeting is to address the nuclear threat 
to the United States.”</p>
<p>All this verbiage suggests the possibility – always subject to change
 at any moment with Trump – that the U.S.-North Korea summit could end 
with Trump stepping back from the brink, by accepting a deal that 
doesn’t fulfill the wishes of hard-liners, while simultaneously claiming
 victory. This is because a continuing freeze on North Korea’s nuclear 
and ICBM testing would be a genuine concession by Kim. While Kim 
recently <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/103295201/north-korea-calls-an-end-to-nuclear-icbm-missile-tests">claimed</a>
 that this cessation was meaningless because North Korea is already 
certain it can successfully hit the U.S. with nuclear missiles, experts,
 like Ploughshare Funds President Joe Cirincione, disagree.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Intercept, Cirincione summarized Kim’s 
position as: “’These are acts of strength, I’ve finished the program, I 
can close the test sites now, I can stop testing, everything’s fine, we 
have our nuclear deterrent.’”</p>
<p>But is that true? “Probably not,” Cirincione says. “At least not by 
the standards of most nuclear armed states. No nuclear armed state has 
willingly stopped their test program with so few tests. All nuclear 
scientists want more tests.”</p>
<p>Cirincione believes the North Koreans, with their nuclear program as 
it currently stands, have around a 50-50 chance of being able to 
successfully utilize a long-range missile to hit the United States. In 
order to improve the odds, they would need more tests.</p>
<p>Kelsey Davenport, director of Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms 
Control Association, agreed. “The accuracy and reliability of those 
systems is low because North Korea has conducted so few tests,” 
Davenport told The Intercept. “So a moratorium on nuclear tests, 
intercontinental ballistic missile tests, could certainly prevent North 
Korea from qualitatively advancing its program.” Davenport notes as a 
caveat that North Korea has cheated on international agreements before 
and that the Trump administration should look for a way to “lock in” 
those commitments during upcoming negotiations. (The U.S. has also 
cheated on its end of the bargain in previous agreements with North 
Korea.)</p>
<p>This is far from what most people would understand as 
“denuclearization.” But it would be an extremely positive first step, 
and it could lay the groundwork for future progress toward real peace.</p>
<p>Both Cirincione and Davenport argue it is possible that with a 
reduction in hostility from the U.S., North Korea could begin a process 
that, in the long term, ends with them actually giving up nuclear 
weapons. (The only country that has built nuclear weapons domestically 
and then renounced them is South Africa. Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Kazakhstan had Russian warheads on their territory but surrendered them 
to Russia after the Soviet Union’s collapse.)</p>
<p>“If Trump thinks that he’s going to come back to the summit with Kim 
Jong-un’s nuclear weapons in the cargo hold of Air Force One, he’s 
delusional,” Cirincione said. “If he goes in prepared to have this be a 
breakthrough meeting that yields important concessions from Kim and is 
the start of a multi-year process toward denuclearization, then he might
 be able to pull off a stunningly successful summit.”</p>
<p>The experts also cautioned that the United States has to be willing 
to truly compromise with North Koreans as well. “Trump also needs to be 
realistic about the concept that this is a negotiation and North Korea’s
 going to want something from the United States in return,” Davenport 
said. She cited U.S. nuclear-capable airplanes taking part in military 
drills and the presence of nuclear-capable submarines as two areas in 
which Kim’s government wants to see real changes.</p>
<p>When asked what they think the chances are that the Trump 
administration might pull this off, both experts landed at the same 
number. “I’d put the odds right now at 50-50. I think there’s actually a
 50 percent chance this unorthodox diplomacy could work,” Cirincione 
said.</p>
<p>“At this point, it is highly likely that the summit will take place, 
but the chances that Trump will be able to obtain a reasonable 
commitment from the North Koreans to take steps to freeze their nuclear 
missile program is 50/50,” Davenport concluded.</p>
<p>Cirincione in particular put much of his hopes in South Korea’s 
progressive new leader. “People have been grossly underestimating the 
role of South Korean President Moon Jae-in. He’s the one who has pushed 
this agenda and gotten us as close as we are,” he said, also alluding to
 his strategic use of flattery to persuade America’s leadership. “The 
South Koreans are handling this very well and all the while by the way 
deflecting praise to Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>Indeed, earlier this year, Moon singled out Trump for praise on the issue, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/09/asia/south-korea-north-korea-talks-moon-intl/index.html">saying</a> “[He] made a huge contribution to make inter-Korean talks happen, [and] I’d like to express my gratitude.”</p>
<p>P.J. Crowley, former assistant secretary for public affairs and 
spokesperson for the State Department under the Obama administration, 
also stresses that U.S. negotiators must be pragmatic.</p>
<p>“It is unrealistic for us to expect North Korea to capitulate in one 
meeting. They have spent a lot of money to produce whatever weapons and 
missiles they have. So the president has to decide if they’re serious 
and if a lengthy negotiation will bear fruit,” he told The Intercept.</p>
