coronavirus receives FDA Emergency Use Authorization and is available in
 markets accepting the CE mark</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">• First commercial test for SARS-CoV-2 will enable expedited coronavirus testing to meet urgent medical needs</p>
<p class="rm-manual">• Testing on widely available, high-volume cobas 6800/8800 will significantly increase available testing capacity</p>
<p class="rm-manual">• Roche expedites test development to support 
urgent need for patient testing during pandemic outbreak to avoid a 
further spread of the virus at an early stage of infection</p>
<p>Basel, 13 March 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today 
announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an
 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the <a href="file:///ae/en/products/params/cobas-sars-cov-2-test.html">cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test</a>.
 It is intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus 
that causes COVID-19 disease, in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab 
samples from patients who meet COVID-19 clinical and/or epidemiological 
criteria for testing. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the 
test on Roche’s fully automated <a href="file:///ae/en/products/systems/cobas-6800-system.html">cobas® 6800</a> and <a href="file:///ae/en/products/systems/cobas-8800-system.html">cobas® 8800 Systems</a>, which are widely available in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p>The CE-IVD test is also available in markets accepting the CE mark 
for patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 disease and living in 
affected areas where the SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to be present.</p>
<p><span>"Providing quality, high-volume testing capabilities will allow
 us to respond effectively to what the World Health Organization has 
characterized as a pandemic. It is important to quickly and reliably 
detect whether a patient is infected with SARS-CoV-2,”</span> said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics.</p>
<p><span>“Over the last weeks, our emergency response teams have been 
working hard to bring this test to the patients. CE-mark certification 
and the FDA’s granting of EUA supports our commitment to give more 
patients access to reliable diagnostics which are crucial to combat this
 serious disease.”</span></p>
<p>The widely available Roche’s cobas 6800/8800 Systems, which are used 
to perform the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test, provide test results and offer 
improved operating efficiency, flexibility, and fastest time-to-results 
with the highest throughput with up to 96 results in about three and a 
half hours and a total of 384 results for the cobas 6800 System and 1056
 results for the cobas 8800 System in 8 hours. The test can be run 
simultaneously with other assays provided by Roche for use on the cobas 
6800/8800 Systems.</p>
<p>Upon authorisation Roche will have millions of tests a month 
available for use on the cobas 6800 and 8800 systems. Roche is committed
 to delivering as many tests as possible and is going to the limits of 
our production capacity.</p>
<p>About Emergency Use Authorization Status</p>
<p>The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test has not been FDA cleared or approved. It 
has been authorized by the FDA under an EUA for use by laboratories 
certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 
(CLIA), 42 U.S.C. § 263a, to perform moderate and high complexity tests.
 The test has been authorised only for the detection of RNA from 
SARS-CoV-2 virus and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, not for 
any other viruses or pathogens. It is only authorised for the duration 
of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorisation
 of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection of 
SARS-CoV-2 virus under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-
 3(b)(1), unless the authorisation is terminated or revoked sooner.</p>
<p>About SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus)</p>
<p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness 
ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East
 Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which has
 not previously been identified in humans.1</p>
<p>Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as cough, 
shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and fever. In more severe 
cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and 
death can occur.</p>
<p>To control the spread of the infection, WHO recommends regular hand 
washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly 
cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing 
symptoms of respiratory illness.</p>
<p>About cobas SARS-CoV-2 Assay</p>
<p>The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test is a single-well dual target assay, which 
includes both specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 and pan-sarbecovirus 
detection for the sarbecovirus subgenus family that includes SARS-CoV-2.
 The test is a real-time RT-PCR test intended for the qualitative 
detection of nucleic acids from SARS-CoV- 2 in nasopharyngeal and 
oropharyngeal swab samples from patients who meet the CDC SARS-CoV-2 
clinical criteria.The test runs on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems and has a
 full-process negative control, positive control and internal control.</p>
<p>Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not 
be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative 
results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, 
and epidemiological information.</p>
<p>The cobas SARS-CoV-2 is intended for use by trained clinical 
laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the 
techniques of real-time PCR and in vitro diagnostic procedures. In the 
United States, the cobas SARS-CoV-2 is only for use under the FDA’s 
Emergency Use Authorization.</p>
<p>About the cobas 6800/8800 Systems</p>
<p>Since 2014, the cobas 6800 and cobas 8800 Systems have established 
the new standard for routine molecular testing by delivering fully 
integrated, automated solutions that serve the areas of viral load 
monitoring, donor screening, sexual health and microbiology. Based on 
Nobel prize-winning PCR technology, the systems deliver proven 
performance with full automation, increased throughput, fast turnaround 
time and complete track connectivity validated for molecular testing, 
providing users with greater flexibility to consolidate their IVD and 
LDT testing to a single system while increasing overall workflow 
efficiencies.</p>
<p>Our global install base for the cobas 6800 and 8800 Systems is 695 
and 132 respectively. The systems provide up to 96 results in about 
three and a half hours and a total of 384 results for the cobas 6800 
System and 1056 results for the cobas 8800 System in 8 hours. Both make 
it possible for labs to perform up to three tests in the same run with 
no pre-sorting required.The systems also enable up to eight hours (cobas
 6800 System) and four hours (cobas 8800 System) of walk-away time with 
minimal user interaction. cobas 6800 and cobas 8800 Systems are the only
 fully automated molecular systems designated as moderately complex by 
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).</p>
