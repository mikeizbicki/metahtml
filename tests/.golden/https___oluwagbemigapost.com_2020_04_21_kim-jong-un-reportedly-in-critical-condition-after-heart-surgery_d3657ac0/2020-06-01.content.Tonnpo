<p class="rm-manual"> <span>Posted on <a href="https://oluwagbemigapost.com/2020/04/21/kim-jong-un-reportedly-in-critical-condition-after-heart-surgery/" rel="bookmark">April 21, 2020</a></span><span> by <span><a href="https://oluwagbemigapost.com/author/face2facegroup/">Oluwagbemiga</a></span></span> </p>
<p>Fears were growing for Kim Jong-un’s health today after a US official
 said the dictator could be in ‘grave danger’ after heart surgery – 
although South Korea has played down the reports.</p>
<p>Washington is monitoring intelligence that Kim is in a critical 
condition after his operation in North Korea, CNN quoted an unnamed US 
official as saying.</p>
<p>Kim, 36, was last seen at a government meeting on April 11, and was 
mysteriously absent from the celebration of his late grandfather Kim 
Il-Sung’s birthday on April 15.</p>

<p>Daily NK, an outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, said Kim 
had undergone a cardiovascular procedure and was recovering at a villa 
in North Phyongan province.</p>
<p>It is unclear what would happen next if fears that Kim is 
‘incapacitated or worse’ prove correct, but his sister Kim Yo-jong is 
among the senior politicians who could be in line to take control.</p>
<p>South Korea has today played down the fears over Kim’s health, saying
 that ‘no special movement has been detected inside North Korea’.</p>
<p>The South’s Yonhap news agency cited an unnamed government official saying that reports Kim was seriously ill were ‘not true’.</p>
<p>The North has imposed even tighter restrictions than usual because of
 the coronavirus pandemic – although it claims to have no cases.</p>
<p>South Korea’s presidential Blue House said: ‘We have no information 
to confirm regarding rumours about Chairman Kim Jong-un’s health issue 
that have been reported by some media outlets.</p>
<p>‘Also, no unusual developments have been detected inside North Korea.’</p>
<p>The Blue House later said Kim was believed to be staying at an 
unspecified location outside of Pyongyang with some of his close 
confidants.</p>
<p>A different US official, speaking to the Associated Press, said the 
White House was already aware of fears about Kim’s health before the 
latest reports surfaced on Monday night.</p>
<p>The official said the US had information that Kim may have undergone 
surgery and that complications may have rendered him ‘incapacitated or 
worse’.</p>
<p>But they stressed that the US had nothing to confirm whether the surgery had taken place or that any complications had occurred.</p>
<p>‘We just don’t know,’ said the official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. The White House and State Department had no comment.</p>
<p>Daily NK, citing unidentified sources inside the isolated state, said
 Kim was recovering at a villa in the Mount Kumgang resort county of 
Hyangsan on the east coast after getting the procedure on April 12 at a 
hospital there.</p>

<p>Kim’s health has deteriorated in recent months due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork, the Daily NK report said.</p>
<p>‘My understanding is that he had been struggling (with cardiovascular
 problems) since last August but it worsened after repeated visits to 
Mount Paektu,’ a source was quoted as saying, referring to the country’s
 sacred mountain.</p>
<p>The dictator’s health fears come after reports that North Korean 
authorities had admitted in public lectures that coronavirus was 
spreading in the country, contradicting the regime’s claims that there 
are no cases.</p>
<p>There was no indication that Kim had contracted the deadly respiratory disease, also known as COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, said
 it couldn’t confirm another report by Daily NK, which cited anonymous 
sources to report that Kim was recovering from heart surgery in the 
capital Pyongyang and that his condition was improving.</p>
<p>Losing the dictator would likely result in a power struggle since Kim has not specifically named a successor.</p>
<p>Among those who are seen as likely candidates who may try to take the top leadership position are Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong.</p>
<p>She was named as an alternate member of the politburo at the April 11
 meeting where Kim was last seen in public, and has represented the 
North Korean government in dealings with the South.</p>
<p>Analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at the private Sejong Institute in South 
Korea said Kim Yo-jong is already exercising significant influence 
within the government.</p>
<p>However, it is thought more likely that a top party leader would take over from Kim.</p>
<p>Given that two of the three members of the Politburo Standing 
Committee are older, its third member, Chairman of the Organization and 
Guidance Department Choe Ryong Hae, is seen as a likely candidate, 
reports NKNews.</p>
<p>Upon the sudden death of Kim Jong-Un, formal rules and regulations in
 the system will likely play a role in deciding who will replace him.</p>
<p>If the leadership is split on a candidate, there may be a formal vote by the Central Committee.</p>
<p>A session of the Supreme People’s Assembly also could be convened to elect a head of state.</p>
<p>However, those votes would likely be formalities after the real decision was made elsewhere, possibly fuelling a power struggle.</p>
<p>Speculation about Kim’s health was first raised after he missed the 
celebration of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung’s 
birthday on April 15.</p>
<p class="">Kim failed to attend the annual Day of the Sun ceremony for 
the first time, sparking speculation about his health amid the 
coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>READ</span> <span>Explosion At Russian Military Base Kills Two</span></p>
<p>The celebration and holiday to mark the birth of his grandfather is 
deeply significant and Kim Jong-Un has not missed it since taking power 
in 2011.</p>
<p>Neither Kim nor his sister attended the ceremony at the Kumsusan 
Palace of the Sun, despite many of his senior officials appearing at the
 wreath laying.</p>
<p>Kim was pictured presiding over the Workers’ Party politburo meeting 
on April 11. On April 12, the North’s official news state media KCNA 
reported that Kim had inspected drills by fighter jets at an air defence
 unit.</p>
<p>State media reported Kim sent greetings to Syrian President Bashar 
Assad last week and a ‘birthday spread’ to a North Korean woman who 
turned 100 on Monday, although he was not seen in public.</p>
<p>In 2014, Kim dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before 
reappearing with a cane. Days later, the South’s spy agency said he had 
undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.</p>
<p>‘No-one knows what’s going on inside North Korea,’ said Martyn Williams, who is affiliated with the 38 North research website.</p>
<p>‘Kim Jong Il had been dead several days before it was announced and it took everyone by surprise,’ he tweeted.</p>
<p>‘Kim Jong-un has been ‘missing’ before, and has always reappeared. That said, his absence this week was more notable.’</p>
<p>But political analysts believe his conspicuous absence on Wednesday 
could point towards a political message Kim wants to send, that he wants
 to step away from the ‘cult of personality’ surrounding the ruling 
dynasty.</p>
<p>It also comes after a massive reshuffle of his inner circle on 
Saturday, in which a third of his leadership council were given their 
marching orders.</p>
<p>His sister, believed to be in her thirties, was also reinstated in 
her role as propaganda chief after being booted out over last year’s 
bungled talks with Donald Trump.</p>
<p>‘Kim Jong-Un wants to break away from the past, as well as the 
North’s traditional cult of personality,’ said Ahn Chan-il, a North 
Korean defector and researcher in Seoul.</p>
<p>‘His message is that Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung’s times are now over,’ he told AFP.</p>
<p>‘He wants to come across and brand himself as a leader who is modern 
and competent, rather than a descendant of his predecessors.</p>
<p>‘And he wants to gradually tone down the idolisation of the two late 
leaders as it goes against his agenda to brand the North as a ‘normal 
state’.’</p>

<p>Alternatively, Kim may have been advised to stay away from public 
gatherings because of coronavirus, despite Pyongyang’s claims that it 
has zero cases of Covid-19. There have been major outbreaks in 
neighbouring South Korea and China.</p>
<p>Although his age does not put him in a high-risk category, it is 
feared that his heavy drinking, smoking and obesity would put the 
36-year-old at grave risk if he were to catch coronavirus.</p>
<p>Kim has been highly active in recent weeks and has been pictured out 
inspecting his military, sometimes with officers wearing face masks, 
while he does not.</p>
<p>Kim was a relative unknown to the West when he ascended to power replacing his father, Kim Jong-il.</p>
<p>His older half-brother Kim Jong-nam had once been seen as the likely 
successor, but fell out of favour and was later assassinated in Malaysia
 in 2017.</p>
<p>The ruling party’s claim to legitimacy has its roots in Kim Il Sung’s
 fight against Korea’s Japanese colonisers and for years the North’s 
official propaganda has promoted Kim Jong-Un’s resemblance to his 
grandfather, in appearance, manner, and even handwriting.</p>
<p>Under Kim, experts say research shows that North Korea has not 
stopped developing nuclear weapons despite ‘denuclearization’ talks with
 the US.</p>
<p>North Korea could have built up to 40 nuclear weapons by the end of 
2019 – a dozen more than Kim Jong-un had the same time the year before, 
researchers claim.</p>
<p>Donald Trump met Kim to discuss the possibility of giving up his 
nukes in Vietnam in February of last year, but talks stalled after North
 Korea demanded immediate relief from US sanctions in return for only 
partial steps toward disarmament.</p>
<p>By year’s end, Kim announced his country’s self-imposed moratorium on
 testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles was over.</p>
