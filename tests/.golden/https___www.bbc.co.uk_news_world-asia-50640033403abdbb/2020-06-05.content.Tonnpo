<h1>North Korea unveils town hailed as 'epitome of civilisation'</h1>

<p>North Korea has officially opened a new town its media is calling the "epitome of modern civilisation". </p>
<p>Leader Kim Jong-un cut the red ribbon at Samjiyon near Mount Paektu 
in the north - hailed as one of the country's most important 
construction projects.</p>
<p>State media KCNA said the town - which is able to accommodate 4,000 
families - boasts new apartments, a ski slope, and a stadium amongst 
other facilities.</p>
<p>However, forced labour is said to have gone into the construction of Samjiyon.</p>
<p>And the town - even if it lives up to state media billing - will be 
an outlier in North Korea, where the majority of people live in poor 
conditions. </p>
<p>According to non-governmental organisation the <a href="https://www.ncnk.org/">National Committee on North Korea</a>, many "suffer from shortages of food, fuel, electricity, running water and other necessities".</p>
<h2>What does the town look like?</h2>
<p>According to Colin Zwirko, a correspondent at specialist site NK News, the town is a "model" of sorts.</p>
<p>"As it appears now, it [has] nice clean facades and unique, ornately 
designed buildings that would not resemble really any other town in 
North Korea," he told the BBC. </p>
<p>"Someone roaming around Samjiyon as a tourist would not stumble into 
less well-kept areas away from the main road, as is the case in 
Pyongyang and other cities."</p>
<p>Mr Zwirko added that the town is "quite small and walkable", measuring around 2-3km in either direction. </p>
<h2>When did construction begin?</h2>
<p>Mr Kim visited Samjiyon town exactly two years ago, where he first announced a big "rebuilding" project.</p>
<p>But it has not exactly been built from the ground up. </p>
<ul> <li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-50064893">North Korean leader rides horse up sacred mountain</a></li> <li><a href="file:///news/uk-england-bristol-50097768">UK artist hand-draws tourist map of Pyongyang</a></li> <li><a href="file:///news/world-asia-40871848">North Korea crisis in 300 words</a></li> </ul>
<p>A town already existed before the reconstruction. Some buildings were
 remodelled, while many more were torn down and replaced with new 
buildings, according to Mr Zwirko.</p>
<p>State media <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2018/07/samjiyon-county-construction-project-includes-400-new-buildings-images-reveal/">previously reported that more than 450 new buildings would be constructed</a>, including industrial and recreational facilities.</p>
<p>KCNA said the town had undergone a "drastic change", <a href="https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1575356451-925187476/detailed-report-on-construction-of-township-area-of-samjiyon-county">describing it as a "utopia town under socialism". </a></p>
<p>It is not clear if anyone has moved in, but the town was previously 
home to some residents - though it is also unclear how many. </p>
<h2>What has gone into building it?</h2>
<p>It's not known how much money has gone into construction of the town.</p>
<p>But construction happened at a time when North Korea is under tough 
sanctions, and its completion shows how much importance the government 
placed on the project.</p>
<ul> <li><a href="file:///news/world-asia-48221507">US seizes North Korean coal ship</a></li> <li><a href="file:///news/world-asia-46585573">North Korea condemns latest US sanctions</a></li> <li><a href="file:///news/world-asia-44234505">North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis</a></li> </ul>
<p>Mr Zwirko said the state "pushed construction regardless of 
resources, and regardless of lack of access to better building materials
 due to sanctions".</p>
<p>There is also evidence, said Mr Zwirko, that forced labour was used to complete the projects. </p>
<p>"We have seen evidence of forced labour in terms of local civilians 
working on the project," he said. "State media even boasts of such work,
 though [they call] them volunteers."</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for local civilians to be "forced" to work on such
 projects, and locals are often "required to contribute to construction 
projects by working and/or providing resources".</p>
<p>"Typically people either comply or some reports tell of [them] bribing their way out," said Mr Zwirko. </p>
<h2>Why is the project important?</h2>
<p>Firstly, for its proximity to Mount Paektu - considered to be a 
sacred mountain in North Korea and said to be the birthplace of Kim 
Jong-un's father.</p>
<p>"It's the town's significance as the [reported] birthplace of Kim 
Jong Il that makes it the big important state construction project that 
it is," said Mr Zwirko.</p>
<p>The town has also been presented as a model for other towns in the country to look up to.</p>
<p>In his annual new year's address this year, Mr Kim directly referenced Samjiyon, <a href="https://www.ncnk.org/resources/publications/kimjongun_2019_newyearaddress.pdf/file_view">calling it an "ideal socialist village".</a></p>
<p>"The whole party, the entire army, and all the people should turn out
 to transform Samjiyon into a model of modern mountainous city, an ideal
 socialist village," he said in his speech. </p>
<p>The opening of the town is just one part of a bigger scheme. It's the
 second stage of a three-stage plan to boost the entire county the town 
is located in.</p>
<p>The three-stage construction project is expected to be complete by October 2020. </p>
<p>So though the town itself has been officially opened, Mr Zwirko has described it as a "soft opening".</p>
<p>"Satellite imagery shows a lot of planned facilities such as the 
hotel resort around the ski hill are not complete and we haven't seen if
 buses are ready to serve the town yet.</p>
<p>"This to me looks like more of a soft opening designed to boost 
morale, and to perhaps allow some money to be recouped through 
small-scale tourism this winter before the big proper opening next 
October."</p>
