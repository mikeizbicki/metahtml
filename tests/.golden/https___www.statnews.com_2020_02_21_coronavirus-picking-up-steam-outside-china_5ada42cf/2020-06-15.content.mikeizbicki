<h1 class="rm-manual">The coronavirus is picking up steam outside China, narrowing chances of eliminating it</h1>

 are worrying signs the coronavirus outbreak is entering a new phase, 
with spread outside of China — until recently at low levels — beginning 
to rapidly pick up steam.</p>
<p>Experts point to the sharp rise of the number of cases in South 
Korea, which went from 30 on Monday to 204 by Friday, and in Italy, 
which had no cases at the start of Friday and 16 at the end of it. Five 
of the infected people in Italy are health workers.</p>
<p>Iran — which began the week with no confirmed cases and ended it with
 18, four of whom have already died — is a particular source of concern,
 having exported two cases within 36 hours of announcing it had found 
two patients infected with the virus. A traveler from Canada and another
 from Lebanon tested positive for the virus after returning home from 
Iran.</p>
<p>The fact that Iran is already exporting cases suggests transmission 
there is far more widespread than the official numbers would indicate, 
said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center
 for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy.</p>

<p>“I think people are missing the importance of a case like the Canadian traveler to Iran,” he said, referring to a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-hit-with-sixth-case-of-coronavirus-after-woman-returns-from-iran/" rel="noopener">case reported</a>
 by health officials in British Columbia on Thursday. “This tells us 
that there has to be a much larger number of people infected in Iran and
 we’re literally just detecting the tip of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>Even Iranian health officials acknowledged that likelihood. “It’s 
possible that it exists in all cities in Iran,” health ministry official
 Minou Mohrez said, according to the official IRNA news agency.</p>
<p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health 
Organization, resisted the notion Friday that the outbreak was at a 
tipping point. But he did tell reporters that the “window of 
opportunity” to stop spread of the virus is shrinking.</p>
<p>“Our window of opportunity is narrowing,” said Tedros, as he is known. “We need to act quickly before it closes completely.”</p>
<p>The WHO has been seeking funding to help developing countries prepare
 to cope with the outbreak and has been urging countries to prepare 
their health systems to respond, if efforts to stop spread of the virus 
fail.</p>
<p>“This outbreak could go in any direction. It could even be messy,” he
 warned. “What I’m saying is: It’s in our hands now. If we do well 
within the narrowing window of opportunity, we can avert any serious 
crisis. If we squander the opportunity, then there will be a serious 
problem on our hands.”</p>
<p>As of Friday there were nearly 77,000 cases reported globally, with 
all but 1,200 reported by China. There were also roughly 2,350 deaths.</p>
<p>The growth in the daily case count in China has been tamped down of 
late by the country’s extraordinary quarantine effort. Cities that are 
home to tens of millions of people have been on virtual lockdown for 
several weeks. While the apparent impact of those measures has instilled
 hope in some that there is still time to stop circulation of the virus,
 skeptics warn that disease levels in China could rebound when the 
country eases its movement restrictions and allows people to return to 
their jobs.</p>
<p>Most of China’s cases have occurred in Hubei province, where the 
outbreak appears to have begun in the city of Wuhan. But Tedros noted 
that there has been a worrying uptick in cases in Shandong province; he 
said the WHO is asking China for more information about that situation.</p>
<p>Gary Kobinger, director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at 
Laval University in Quebec, also said Friday he believes stopping the 
virus is still a possibility. Kobinger is on an expert committee that 
advises the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program; the group wrote <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30374-3/fulltext" rel="noopener">a recent letter</a>
 to the journal The Lancet urging the world to continue to try to stop 
spread and eliminate the virus, as was done with the virus responsible 
for the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>“We’re not at the tipping point to say ‘OK, this is now unstoppable.’
 I don’t think we are there yet, personally,” Kobinger told STAT. “We’re
 definitely in a grey zone where you could argue both ways and be wrong 
or right both ways.”</p>
<p>Osterholm and others suggested overly narrow testing protocols are 
obscuring the world’s ability to see how far the virus has spread. In 
the United States, for instance, the Centers for Disease Control only 
recommends testing people who have symptoms and have been to China or 
who have symptoms and have been in contact with a suspected or confirmed
 case.</p>
<p>“Basically if you get tested and you’re found and you’re positive, 
then we know. But how many people right now are not being tested who are
 just like this case in Canada?” he asked.</p>
<p>If the Canadian doctor who caught the country’s most recent case had 
been following that type of protocol, the woman who returned from Iran 
would not have been tested for Covid-19, the disease the new virus 
causes.</p>
<p>Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s provincial health officer, said an 
astute emergency department doctor ordered the test because of the 
woman’s recent international travel. It turned out to be a good call.</p>
<p>“It is not something we are recommending … but we have had a low 
threshold for testing and the lab will test if there is a request from 
an emergency room with compatible symptoms,” Henry said.</p>

<p>Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for 
Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday that the agency may 
broaden its recommendations for who should be tested if spread in 
countries outside of China continues to grow.</p>
<p>With the rapid upswing in cases in multiple countries, a number of 
experts are warning the world needs to plan for wider global spread of 
this virus.</p>
<p>“We need to start with assumption that we will be facing a pandemic,”
 said Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the 
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “If that doesn’t come to pass,
 then great. But I think we have an opportunity to learn from the 
lessons that we’re observing in Hubei province. And it’s in our best 
interest to lean in on that.”</p>
