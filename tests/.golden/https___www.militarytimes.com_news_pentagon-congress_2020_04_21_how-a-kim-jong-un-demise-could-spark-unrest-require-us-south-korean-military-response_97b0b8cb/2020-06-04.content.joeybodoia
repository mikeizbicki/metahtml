<h1 class="rm-manual">How a Kim Jong Un demise could spark unrest, require US, South Korean military response </h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span> <span><a href="file:///author/howard-altman" rel="author">Howard Altman</a></span> </span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> April 21 </p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"> In this undated photo provided Nov. 25, 
2019, by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, 
center, poses as he inspects a women's company under Unit 5492 of the 
Korean People's Army in North Korea. (Korean Central News Agency/Korea 
News Service via AP) </figcaption><p> A<a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/training-sim/2020/03/30/north-korea-test-fires-missiles-amid-worries-about-outbreak/"> Kim Jong Un</a>
 demise could destabalize the region, create a massive refugee flow and 
force the U.S., South Korea and possibly other regional allies to react 
to the upheaval.</p>
<p> That’s how experts contacted by Military Times see a Kim-less future possibly unfolding in the nuclear-armed Hermit Kingdom.</p>
<p> The questions about what would happen should Kim die or be 
incapacitated were sparked by a CNN report that the North Korean despot 
was in “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html">grave danger</a>”
 following a surgery. However, the Yonhap News Agency, a South 
Korean-government funded organization, later tweeted out that there were
 “no unusual signs” of Kim’s health.</p>
<p> But even if he isn’t on his death bed, Kim does have health issues 
and his exit from the stage would create turmoil, experts say.</p>
<p> Without a designated heir there will be “chaos, human suffering, 
instability,” retired South Korean Lt. Gen. Chun In-Bum, the former head
 of his nation’s special operations forces, told Military Times. “It’s 
bad news for everyone.”</p>
<p> David Maxwell, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of 
Democracies think tank who has two decades of military service in Asia 
said a U.S. and South Korean military reaction to that upheaval could 
require an effort that “will make Afghanistan and Iraq pale in 
comparison."</p>
<p> Like Chun, Maxwell, a retired Special Forces colonel who served with
 him, said a lack of clear succession would set chaos into motion.</p>
<p> Kim Il Sung designated his son successor in 1973 and the Kim Il-sung designated his son success in 2009 or 2010.</p>

<p> “It is unknown whether Kim Jong-un has designated a successor,” said
 Maxwell. "We can speculate that perhaps his sister Kim Yo-jong has been
 designated as his successor based on her recent promotion and the fact 
she has begun making official statements in her name beginning last 
month."</p>
<p> But it is unknown, said Maxwell, “whether a woman, despite being 
part of the Paektu bloodline could become the leader of the Kim family 
regime.”</p>
<p> No clear successor could lead to a regime collapse, said Maxwell, 
with the Kim regime and the Workers Party of Korea unable to govern the 
north or maintain military cohesion and support.</p>
<p> What happens then is a wild card, with a lot of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/10/when-north-korea-falls/305228/">bad possible outcomes</a>
 that the South Korean/U.S. alliance must be prepared to handle, said 
Maxwell. He added that military planners, including himself, have long 
briefed senior leaders on what could transpire.</p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual">Graphic courtesy David Maxwell, a 30-year 
veteran of the U.S. Army and a retired Special Forces colonel, is a 
senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). From 
his report at http://www.icks.org/data/ijks/1482467285_add_file_7.pdf. 
It was created to brief the DoD leadership (to include SECDEF William 
Cohen) in the 1990s to illustrate the complexity and uncertainty of 
regime instability and collapse.</figcaption><p> There is a 
“humanitarian disaster that will unfold in North Korea,” said Maxwell. 
It will be further complicated by the coronavirus.</p>
<p> “South Korea, China, and Japan (via boat) are going to have to deal 
with potential large scale refugee flows,” he said. “Units of the North 
Korean People’s Army are going to compete for resources and survival. 
This will lead to internal conflict among units and could escalate to 
widespread civil war.”</p>
<p> But even such internal strife won’t hinder the North’s animus toward
 the outside or its willingness to fight if they feel it is warranted.</p>
<p> “Since North Korea is a Guerrilla Dynasty built on the myth of 
anti-Japanese partisan warfare we can expect large numbers of the 
military (1.2 million active duty and 6 million reserves) to resist any 
and all outside foreign intervention to include from South Korea,” said 
Maxwell.</p>
<p> And then there are the North Korea weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p> “Lastly the ROK/US alliance is going to have to be prepared to 
secure and render safe the entire WMD program, nuclear, chemical, 
biological weapons and stockpiles, manufacturing facilities, and human 
infrastructure (scientists and technicians),” said Maxwell. “This is a 
contingency operation that will make Afghanistan and Iraq pale in 
comparison.”</p>
<p> The U.S./South Korean alliance “has contingency plans for this,” 
Maxwell said. “It will be a combined effort because neither South Korea 
nor the U.S. can execute this alone.”</p>
<p> Those plans, however, have been “too long-neglected,” said Maxwell, 
adding that the cancellation of many high-level training exercises 
hasn’t helped.</p>
<p> In addition, the “friction of burden sharing as well as the move of 
U.S. forces out of Seoul to Camp Humphreys” means “the alliance is just 
not as well trained, ready, and solid as it has been in the past.”</p>
<p> Chun, the retired South Korean general, largely agreed with Maxwell 
about the refugees and potential civil war in the north, but does not 
see a U.S./South Korean military incursion past the 38th Parallel.</p>
<p> “What are we going to do? March in there?? Let the Chinese do it,” 
he said. “The DPRK is a sovereign country. Anyone going in there, 
including the Chinese, would be crazy. The ROK/US has a bad plan with 
bad assumptions. It will get us into a nuclear war.”</p>
