<h1>Long Overdue Plant Hardiness Map is a Hothouse</h1>

<p><span><span>2012 plant hardiness zone map. Click for interactive image: USDA and Oregon State University</span></span></p>
<p>The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) released a long overdue new 
version of their Plant Hardiness Zone Map yesterday—the first update 
since 1990.</p>
<p>How out of date was the 1990 map? It was based on data from 1974 to 1986. That’s 26 years ago. </p>
<p>The new map is <a href="http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/#">interactive</a>,
 which is cool, and based on a much finer data scale than the old one, 
which is great. And guess what. It shows that things are getting warmer.
 The USDA managed to pretty much bury that fact in Bureaucratese in 
their press release (highlights are mine):</p>
<p>Compared to the 1990 version, zone boundaries in this edition of the 
map have shifted in many areas. The new map is generally one 5-degree 
Fahrenheit half-zone warmer than the previous map throughout much of the
 United States. This is mostly a result of using temperature data from a
 longer and more recent time period; the new map uses data measured at 
weather stations during the 30-year period 1976-2005. In contrast, the 
1990 map was based on temperature data from only a 13-year period of 
1974-1986.</p>
<p><span><span>1990 USDA plant hardiness: USDA</span></span></p>
<p>In the 1990 map above you can see the scale is less fine. But you can
 also tell at a glance where things have changed in a big way, compared 
to the 2012 map… in the southern Rockies, southern Appalachians, upper 
Michigan, swathes of the Canadian and Mexican borders, coastal 
California, etc.</p>
<p>The 2012 map comes with its own interesting climate-phobic history, as noted by Cornell University’s <a href="http://blogs.cornell.edu/gblblog/2012/01/25/usda-issues-new-hardiness-zone-map/">gardening.cornell.edu</a>: </p>
<p>In 2003 the American Horticultural Society released a draft version 
of a new map based on data from 1986 to 2002, which showed dramatic 
northward movement of hardiness zones. USDA pulled this map from 
circulation and had said they would release an updated map in 2005. 
Instead, in 2006 the Arbor Day Foundation <a href="http://www.arborday.org/media/map_change.cfm">issued a map</a> noting that indeed climate zones had<a href="http://www.arborday.org/media/mapchanges.cfm"> shifted significantly</a> from 1990 to 2006, implying that the <a href="http://www.arborday.org/media/zonechanges2006.cfm">climate was warming</a>. The map released today by USDA <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2105366,00.html">confirms many of these trends</a>.</p>
<p><span><span>2006 Arbor Day plant hardiness map: <a href="http://www.arborday.org/media/map_change.cfm">Arbor Day Foundation</a></span></span></p>
<p>Here’s the 2006 <a href="http://www.arborday.org/media/map_change.cfm">Arbor Day Foundation</a>
 map, using the same scale as the 1990 map. You can see how things have 
warmed and how the planting zones are shifting north. If you parse this 
map against the finer-scale of the 2012 map, they look pretty much the 
same. </p>
