<figcaption class="rm-manual">AccuWeather</figcaption><p>It’s time to buckle up ladies and gentlemen. Put aside the <a href="http://rare.us/rare-news/man-fakes-coronavirus-walmart/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coronavirus pandemic,</a>
 and focus on the weather. Two months from now the 2020 Atlantic 
hurricane season will officially begin, meteorologists from AccuWeather 
have already started examining the factors that can influence tropical 
activity for this year. Forecasters are anticipating a busy year for the
 Atlantic Basin in 2020, which is on the heels of an active 2019 season.</p>
<p>AccuWeather top hurricane expert and meteorologist,<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/accuweathers-2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-forecast/705233" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dan Kottlowski, </a>
 just released the 2020 Atlanta and hurricane forecast. Along with this 
team, they are calling for 14 to 18 tropical storms during the upcoming 
season, which will run from June 1st through November 30th, 2020. Of 
those storms, they are expecting 7 to 9 to become hurricanes, and 2 to 4
 are predicted to strengthen into major hurricanes. According to 
Kottlowski, “It’s going to be an above-normal season. In a normal year, 
we have around 12 storms, six hurricanes, and roughly three major 
hurricanes.”</p>

<p>Hurricane season begins in about two months, but AccuWeather 
forecasters have already examined what could influence tropical activity
 this year — and they are pointing to 2005 as a year that shares a 
similar pattern:<a href="https://t.co/U6ui7JE7VN">https://t.co/U6ui7JE7VN</a></p>

<p>Last year marked the four consecutive years of above-average activity
 in the basin, tying in 1969 for the fourth most active hurricane active
 season on record. Featuring, <a href="https://www.wideopeneats.com/recipes/pitcher-hurricane-cocktail/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hurricane</a>
 Dorian, Lorenzo, and Humberto as well as Tropical storm Imelda, the 
2019 season resulted in 18 storms and cost more than $11 billion in 
heavy damages. Most significantly, the damage affected North Carolina 
leaving severe damage to the coastal and central regions.</p>
<p>Forecasters have also drawn comparisons to previous years with 
comparable weather conditions, also known as analog years as part of the
 method to formulate this season’s predictions. For 2020, AccuWeather 
meteorologists are looking closely at the years 1980 and 2005.</p>
<p>Led by Dan Kottlowksi, AccuWeather’s top hurricane expert, 
meteorologists released the 2020 Atlantic hurricane forecast. Kottlowski
 has worked as a meteorologist at AccuWeather for 43 years and has been 
predicting hurricane behavior throughout his career: <a href="https://t.co/U6ui7JE7VN">https://t.co/U6ui7JE7VN</a> <a href="https://t.co/l6kAka5R4H">pic.twitter.com/l6kAka5R4H</a></p>

<p>Back in 1980, Hurricane Allen developed a category 5 storm, which 
wreaked havoc on Haiti before moving over to lower Texas which killed 
more than 200 people. The expert stated 2005 was a “hyperactive year,” 
which resulted in 28 storms.<a href="http://rare.us/rare-news/11-dead-storms-midwest-south/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> There were so many storms</a>
 in 2005 that the predetermined list of names for the season was heavily
 surpassed and the last few storms took on Greek letters as names Which 
were set by the World Meteorologist Organization.</p>
