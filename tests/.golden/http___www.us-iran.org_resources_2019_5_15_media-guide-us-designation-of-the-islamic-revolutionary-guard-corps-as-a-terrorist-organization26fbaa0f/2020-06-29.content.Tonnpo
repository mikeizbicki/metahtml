<h1><a href="file:///resources/2019/5/15/media-guide-us-designation-of-the-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-as-a-terrorist-organization">Media Guide: U.S. Designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Terrorist Organization</a></h1>
<p class="rm-manual">By AIC Research Fellow Andrew Lumsden</p>
<p>On April 8, 2019, U.S. President Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-designation-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-foreign-terrorist-organization/">announced</a>
 that the United States would formally designate Iran’s Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organization. President
 Trump argued that the IRGC “actively participates in, finances, and 
promotes terrorism,” and that by labeling it a terror group, the U.S. 
would send “a clear message” to Iran that “support for terrorism has 
serious consequences.”</p>
<p>Trump’s move represents the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-designation-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-foreign-terrorist-organization/">first time</a>
 the United States has labeled a part of another country’s government a 
terror group and it has sparked widely varying reactions from all over 
the world and intense scholarly speculation as to how the move will 
impact global politics. </p>
<p>This Media Guide will explain what the IRGC is, what it means to be 
labeled a terrorist organization by the U.S., how the move has been 
received in Iran and internationally, and what consequences it is 
projected to have for both Iran and the United States. </p>
<p>What is the IRGC and what does it do?</p>
<p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was created soon after the 1979
 Iranian Revolution by inaugural Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini to protect the new government from perceived internal threats, <a href="https://www.dw.com/cda/en/what-is-irans-revolutionary-guard/a-40948522">particularly</a> from royalist holdovers in the regular military. The Corps in enshrined in Iran’s <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Iran_1989.pdf?lang=en">constitution</a>, and tasked with “guarding the Revolution and its achievements.” </p>
<p>The <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44017.pdf">IRGC</a> is 
entirely separate from Iran’s regular armed forces and is under the 
direct control of the Supreme Leader. It has its own ground force of 
about 125,000 men, as well as a navy of about 20,000 small ships and 
patrol boats. The Revolutionary Guards operate Iran’s ballistic 
missiles, monitor its coastlines and oversee the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44017.pdf">Basij</a>,
 a volunteer militia which cracks down on internal dissent through 
intimidation, detentions and violence against government critics and 
protesters. </p>
<p>The IRGC also has a <a href="http://www.us-iran.org/resources/2017/9/13/media-guide-on-the-irgc-and-al-quds-force">sizable presence</a> in Iran’s politics and economy. Its veterans hold seats in Parliament and its members control a <a href="https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/04/08/the-revolutionary-guards-disinformation-campaign-to-dominate-irans-economy/">network</a>
 of companies involved in oil extraction, telecommunications, 
construction and engineering among others. It is estimated that the IRGC
 controls as much as <a href="https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/04/08/the-revolutionary-guards-disinformation-campaign-to-dominate-irans-economy/">25%</a> of Iran’s publicly traded companies and <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44017.pdf">20%</a> of the overall economy. Iran’s Parliament gave the IRGC a 2019 <a href="https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-defense-ministry-budget-declines-irgc-more-funding/29679511.html">budget</a> of US $4.7 billion, more than double that of the regular military.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the IRGC is its <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44017.pdf">Quds Force</a>.
 Whereas the rest of the IRGC focuses on securing the Iranian 
government, Quds Force is responsible for expanding its influence 
throughout the region. With about 10,000-15,000 personnel, Quds Force 
provides material, advisory and combat <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44017.pdf">support</a>
 to pro-Iranian parties and leaders throughout the Middle East, 
particularly in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, the Palestinian 
Territories and Yemen. Many of the factions supported by Quds Force, 
such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip have long been 
considered <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm">terrorist organizations</a> by the United States. </p>
<p>For more information, please see AIC’s 2017 <a href="http://www.us-iran.org/resources/2017/9/13/media-guide-on-the-irgc-and-al-quds-force">Media Guide on the IRGC and Quds Force</a></p>
<p>What does it mean to be designated a terrorist group by the United States?</p>
<p>Established under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 
of 1996, the U.S. Department of State’s list of Foreign Terrorist 
Organizations (FTOs) <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm">reflects</a>
 organizations outside its borders which the U.S. government feels 
engage in terrorist activity that threaten the national security of the 
United States or Americans abroad. With the addition of Iran’s 
Revolutionary Guard Corps, 68 organizations are now designated as 
terrorist groups by the United States including al-Qaeda and ISIS. </p>
<p>Once an organization is designated an FTO, </p>
<p>It becomes <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2339B">illegal</a>
 to “knowingly” provide “material support or resources” to it, on 
penalty of up to 20 years in prison or life in prison if said support 
results in deaths. </p>
<p>Any <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2339B">financial institutions</a>
 which hold funds or other assets belonging to the group must freeze 
them and notify U.S. authorities, or face substantial fines. </p>
<p>Any members of the group who are not U.S. citizens are <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm">banned</a> from entering the country and those in the country can be removed. </p>
<p>Furthermore, per the <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm">U.S. State Department</a>,
 addition to the FTO list also serves to raise public awareness and 
knowledge of these groups and the danger they pose in the U.S. and 
abroad and to discourage non-U.S. economic and government entities from 
dealing with the group. </p>
<p>Organizations can be <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm">removed</a>
 from the FTO list at any time if the U.S. State Department believes 
that they no longer pose a threat to the country. Thirteen organizations
 so far have been removed from the FTO list including Cambodia’s 
notorious Khmer Rouge. Also, any organization designated an FTO has the <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm">right to appeal</a> the decision in U.S. federal court within 30 days. </p>
<p>Why has the U.S. designated the IRGC a terrorist organization? </p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm">official statement</a>
 on the matter, the U.S. Department of State said that its decision to 
add the IRGC to its list of terrorist organizations stems from the 
Guards’ role in planning uncovered bombing, assassination and espionage 
plots in Germany, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Kenya, Bahrain, Turkey and the 
United States since 2011. The U.S. also accuses Iran and the IRGC of 
harboring and aiding members of al-Qaeda. </p>
<p>As to how it believes FTO designation of the IRGC will advance U.S. 
interests, the State Department was vague, saying only that the move 
will send a “clear message to the world that the Administration is 
committed to exerting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime.”</p>
<p>Some analysts posit that the IRGC’s designation was indeed an 
entirely symbolic gesture on the part of the Trump administration to 
emphasize its commitment to combating Iran and its regional allies. </p>
<p>Dr. Sanam Vakil of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/trump-terrorist-designation-of-irans-irgc-the-economic-impact.html">argues</a>
 that Trump wants to be seen as “upping the ante” against Iran because 
so far, his policy approach “has yet to see any change in Iranian 
behavior.” </p>
<p>Former State Department counterterrorism officials <a href="http://time.com/5566817/iran-terrorist-designation-irgc-trump/">Daniel Benjamin and Jason Blazakis</a> agree, arguing that Trump’s move was meant solely to give “the illusion of decisive action,” with regard to Iran.</p>
<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/concerns-trump-administration-laying-legal-groundwork-military-action/story?id=62360052">Tess Bridgeman</a>,
 former National Security Council adviser, goes further, arguing that by
 calling the IRGC an anti-U.S. terror group, the Trump administration 
may be “priming the public” for a military conflict with Iran. </p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/5566817/iran-terrorist-designation-irgc-trump/">Those</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/concerns-trump-administration-laying-legal-groundwork-military-action/story?id=62360052">who</a> <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/us-names-iranian-revolutionary-guard-terrorist-organization-and-sanctions-international-criminal">say</a>
 the designation was symbolic point to the fact that the IRGC and Iran 
in general have already been under strict economic sanctions from the 
United States and others. The FTO designation, they argue, will not 
significantly restrict the IRGC any more than it already is. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-israel-netanyahu-iran-revolutionary-guard-election-20190408-story.html">others </a>have
 argued that Trump’s move was on the behalf of Israel’s conservative 
prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch ally of the U.S. president
 and at the time, in the midst of a tight and contentious re-election 
campaign. Tel Aviv-based Middle East analyst Shimrit Meir, calls Trump’s
 designation “last-minute help from afar for pal Netanyahu.” Raz Zimmt, a
 Tel Aviv University Iran expert agrees, saying that although it is 
debatable, Trump’s move “appears connected to the [Israeli] elections. 
Iran’s Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-trump-designated-iran-guards-a-terror-group-at-his-request/">Zarif</a>,
 has also advanced this theory, writing on Twitter that putting the IRGC
 on the terror list was just a “election-eve gift to Netanyahu.” </p>
<p>What has been the reaction to the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist group?</p>
<p>In the United States</p>
<p>Reaction to the designation in the U.S. has been mixed, including within the government. <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2019/04/290973.htm">State Department</a>
 Iran advisor Brian Hook and counterterrorism official Nathan Sales 
assert that the move will make Iran’s economy, over which the IRGC has 
substantial influence, “radioactive” to those investors still thinking 
about doing business in the country. On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/08/trump-iran-revolutionary-guard-pentagon-1261448">Department of Defense</a>,
 particularly the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and top policy 
officials, reportedly opposed the designation on the grounds that it 
could put U.S. servicemen in the region at risk. </p>
<p>Reaction in the U.S. Congress, has largely been along party lines with nearly all Republicans, including prominent Senators <a href="http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/marco-rubio-mike-waltz-back-trump-designating-irans-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps">Marco Rubio</a> (R-FL), <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=4409">Ted Cruz</a> (R-TX) and <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorRomney/status/1115284138825797632">Mitt Romney</a> (R-UT) expressing support for the designation. Democratic Congresswoman <a href="https://twitter.com/Ilhan/status/1115617331089235968">Ilhan Omar</a> from Minnesota signaled her opposition to the move on Twitter, while Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) introduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1039/cosponsors">legislation</a> which would bar all military action against Iran without congressional approval. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.jns.org/jewish-pro-israel-groups-react-positively-to-us-designation-of-irgc-as-terrorist-group/">Many</a>
 Jewish and pro-Israel groups, including the influential American Israel
 Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), and United Against A Nuclear Iran, 
chaired by former Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT), also backed the 
designation and called for even tougher sanctions against Iran. </p>
<p>In Iran </p>
<p>Iranian officials were vociferous in their condemnation of the U.S. designation. </p>
<p>The IRGC’s head at the time, <a href="http://english.almanar.com.lb/718742">Maj. General Ali Jaafari</a>, called it “ridiculous” and pledged that the Corps “will grow stronger in the coming year…more than ever before.” </p>
<p>Supreme Leader Ayatollah <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47865522">Ali Khamenei</a>, praised the IRGC, saying they have “always defended the country.” He <a href="https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1115554812769259520">added</a> the U.S.’ moves against the Guards “won't get them anywhere.” </p>
<p>President <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47865522">Hassan Rouhani</a>, who has himself had a <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/03/iran-irgc-saffar-harandi-jafari-hajizadeh-rouhani-election.html?fbclid=IwAR0BxLcmU3cyZUqxW2gct1PUpGkZcu7xmOYvoRn-7CGWAD31gmhegn0uaig">contentious</a> <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/theocracy-vs-democracy-in-iran-a-new-round-in-an-old-conflict">relationship</a>
 with the IRGC, blasted Washington as the “leader of world terrorism." 
He warned that “this mistake will unite Iranians and the Guards will 
grow more popular.” </p>
<p><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/iranian-deputies-warn-u-s-of-retaliation-if-revolutionary-guards-designated-terror-group/29866211.html">Mohammad Javad Zarif</a>,
 Iran’s Foreign Minister said that the Trump administration is trying to
 “drag the U.S. into a quagmire” with the designation, and <a href="http://www.irna.ir/en/News/83269978">suggested</a> that U.S. military forces should be designated terrorists by Iran. </p>
<p>Chairman of the Expediency Council and former Chief Justice, <a href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/143982/Iran-will-not-keep-quiet-about-US-acts-on-IRGC-Amoli-Larijani">Amoli Larijani</a>
 said that “Iran will not keep quiet” in opposing the United States and 
that there are “many possible ways for the Islamic Republic to 
counteract.”</p>
<p>On April 9, 2019, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/58707df8-5ab2-11e9-939a-341f5ada9d40">legislators</a>
 from all political factions, including Speaker Ali Larijani and 
Reformist majority leader Mohammad Reza Aref wore IRGC uniforms on the 
floor of Parliament and chanted “Death to America.” Leading <a href="https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iranian-reformists-unanimously-condemn-us-irgc-blacklisting/">reformist</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mah_sadeghi/status/1115471723464282117">lawmakers</a> and <a href="http://www.etemadnewspaper.ir/fa/main/page">journalists</a> also issued statements of solidarity with the IRGC.</p>
<p>Tehran formally retaliated against the U.S. on April 11 by 
designating its military’s Central Command (CENTCOM), which oversees 
U.S. troops in the Middle East, as a terrorist organization, and U.S. 
servicemen under its command as terrorists. Parliament passed a <a href="http://english.almanar.com.lb/718742">bill</a> confirming this move by a margin of 254-2. On April 23, Parliament <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/iranian-parliament-labels-entire-us-military-terrorist-62569423">passed </a>another
 bill labeling the entire U.S. military as a terrorist organization by a
 margin of 173-4. The bills prohibit provision of assistance to U.S. 
forces. Ultimately however, it remains unclear exactly what impact, if 
any, Iran’s designation will have on the U.S. military. </p>
<p>The designation also sparked <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190413-iran-demonstrations-against-us-blacklisting-of-revolutionary-guards/">demonstrations</a>
 across the country, with thousands rallying with signs reading “I’m a 
Guard Too,” as well as other pro-IRGC and anti-U.S. slogans. “I’m a 
Guard Too,” also became a <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/04/iran-irgc-fto-designation-reactions-rouhani-khamenei.html">trending</a> slogan on social media in Iran, although <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/is-irans-revolutionary-guard-a-terror-group-as-us-says/a-48262427">support</a>
 for the U.S. move could also be found. Some online commentators have 
recounted their experiences of torture and false imprisonment at the 
hands of the IRGC and agree that it is an “oppressive” organization 
undeserving of popular approval.</p>
<p>In the Wider Middle East</p>
<p>Reactions to the U.S.’ designation among other Middle Eastern 
countries has been mixed, with the U.S.’ close regional allies standing 
in solidarity, its adversaries issuing blistering condemnations and 
others calling for mutual de-escalation of tensions. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1480026/saudi-arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>,
 Iran’s chief regional adversary and close ally of the United States, 
backed the designation, hailing it as a “serious and practical step” in 
fighting terrorism. Saudi Arabia designated the IRGC as a terror 
organization in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-bahrain-security-iran/saudi-bahrain-add-irans-irgc-to-terror-lists-spa-idUSB2N1VO028">2018</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-israel-netanyahu-iran-revolutionary-guard-election-20190408-story.html">Israel</a>’s
 Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his thanks to U.S. 
President Donald Trump for the move and wrote that in doing so he is 
“keeping the world safe from Iran’s aggression and terrorism.” Netanyahu
 also appeared to confirm suspicions that the designation was a favor to
 him, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-israel-netanyahu-iran-revolutionary-guard-election-20190408-story.html">thanking </a>President Trump for “acceding to another one of my important requests.” </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-bahrain-idUSKCN1RK1VK">Bahrain</a> has expressed support for the U.S’ designation, having itself labeled the IRGC a terrorist group in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-bahrain-security-iran/saudi-bahrain-add-irans-irgc-to-terror-lists-spa-idUSB2N1VO028">2018</a>. The Kingdom further <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/bahrain-arrests-116-on-charges-of-terrorism-iran-collusion/a-42814332">accused</a> the IRGC of supporting Shi’a Islamist terror groups in its territory. </p>
<p><a href="https://sana.sy/en/?p=163509">Syria</a>’s state-run media 
reports that President Bashar al-Assad has condemned the U.S.’ 
designation as “irresponsible” and as yet another “erroneous” U.S. 
policy contributing to instability in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The leader of <a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/04/10/593106/US-blacklisting-IRGC-Middle-East-Nasrallah">Hezbollah</a>,
 a Lebanon-based Shi’a Islamist political party and militant group 
backed by Iran, Hassan Nasrallah, condemned the U.S. move as “impudence 
and folly.” He warned that the IRGC, his group and other Iranian allies 
have “many cards up [their sleeves] to respond to US sanctions and 
measures.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/10042019">Iraq</a>’s
 Prime Minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi said that he had tried to stop the 
U.S. designation. He warned Washington that labeling the IRGC a 
terrorist group would “have negative ramifications for Iraq and the 
region.” However, Abdul-Mahdi added that his concerns were ignored. He 
pledged that Iraq will “distance itself from any rivalry [between Iran 
and the U.S.]” and maintain “good relations with the two sides.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1480316/middle-east">Turkey</a>’s
 Foreign Minister said that while his country does not support the 
IRGC’s activities, “no country can declare another country’s armed 
forces a terrorist organization.” He warned that Washington’s “one-sided
 decision” may lead to instability in the Middle East. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1480316/middle-east">Qatar</a>’s Foreign Minister said that any disagreements with Iran’s behavior should not be addressed by imposing sanctions. </p>
<p>In East Asia</p>
<p><a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20190409_29/">Japan</a>’s
 Foreign Minister asserted that his country would not support the U.S.’ 
designation of the IRGC as a terror group, nor would it follow suit. He 
asserted that any problems with Iran must be solved through dialogue. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1652690.shtml">China</a>’s
 Foreign Ministry spokesman said that “non-regional major powers” should
 “do more to contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East and 
refrain from actions that might lead to further escalation of tensions 
in the region.”</p>
<p>In Europe</p>
<p>Although critical of the Trump administration's 2018 re-imposition of
 economic sanctions on Iran, European leaders have largely been <a href="https://en.radiofarda.com/a/europe-stays-silent-over-designation-of-guards-as-terrorist-group-/29878754.html">silent</a> on its designation of the IRGC as a terror group. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.radiofarda.com/a/europe-stays-silent-over-designation-of-guards-as-terrorist-group-/29878754.html">French</a>
 President Emmanuel Macron reportedly spoke to Rouhani after the 
designation, but did not discuss it, focusing instead on Iranian 
political prisoners, recent floods and economic sanctions. </p>
<p>However, Iran’s state-affiliated Mehr News Agency reports that a <a href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/143972/Britain-rejects-US-demand-for-labeling-IRGC-terrorist-group">British</a>
 government representative in Iran has informed them that his country 
has no intention of supporting the American designation of the IRGC.</p>
<p>What ramifications will the designation have for Iran and the United States?</p>
<p>Since its announcement, the question of what consequences the U.S. 
designation of the IRGC will have for the sides involved, has been the 
topic of much speculation and debate among Middle East experts all over 
the world. </p>
<p>Some potential ramifications include: </p>
<p>· Loss of Foreign Investment for Iran</p>
<p>Mark Dubowitz, head of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-08/irgc-terrorist-designation-trump-offers-clarity-on-iran-s-aims">argues</a>
 that given that the IRGC has such a prominent presence in Iran’s 
business atmosphere, the U.S. designating it a terrorist group will 
scare off potential foreign investors, particularly Europeans, who 
hitherto have demonstrated interest in doing business in Iran despite 
U.S. sanctions. He notes that if these investors are caught doing 
business with IRGC-linked companies, they could face personal sanctions 
by the U.S. including visa revocation - something Dubowitz doubts they 
will be willing to risk. Heritage Foundation Fellow <a href="https://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/sanctioning-revolutionary-guard-terrorist-group-will-hit-iran-hard-heres-why">James Phillips</a>
 agrees, adding that those planning to invest in Iran also now face the 
threat of criminal prosecution by the U.S., which may further deter 
them. </p>
<p>It should be noted that on April 24, 2018, the Trump administration <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/440502-us-grants-exemptions-to-sanctions-on-elite-iranian-military-unit">announced </a>that
 it would not automatically apply sanctions or travel bans to government
 entities or businesses found to be doing business with the IRGC. This 
calls into question the extent to which the designation will impact the 
IRGC’s business activities or Iran’s economy. Also, even if Dubowitz and
 Phillips are correct and the designation does lead to the weakening of 
Iran’s economy, the country’s Parliament has consistently given the IRGC
 a sizable budget regardless of the country’s economic health. </p>
<p>· International Erosion of U.S. Credibility</p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/5566817/iran-terrorist-designation-irgc-trump/">Benjamin and Blazakis</a>,
 former State Department counterterrorism officials, assert that the 
Trump administration’s designation of the IRGC is a serious blow to the 
international credibility of the United States as a leader in the global
 war on terrorism and to the U.S.’ relationship with its European 
allies. This is because the U.S. terror list has hitherto been regarded 
as the “gold standard” among America’s allies, meaning that they 
accepted that any group designated by the U.S. was a genuine threat and 
eagerly committed their support to Washington’s efforts. </p>
<p>They accuse the Trump administration of simply using terrorist 
designation to throw “the nearest piece of furniture at Iran,” and argue
 that America’s allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere can see 
this clearly and in the future may regard U.S. designations as 
“questionable claims and not as the irreproachable product of the 
world’s foremost intelligence community.”</p>
<p>· Weakening of Iranian Reformists</p>
<p>Another consequence of the designation put forth by experts, which 
appears to have begun to materialize, is the further weakening of 
moderates and reformists in Iranian politics. Golnaz Esfandiari, senior 
correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/irgc-terrorist-designation-raises-us-stakes-over-iran/29871127.html">argues</a>
 that the designation has linked criticism of the IRGC with support for 
the U.S. and its politics, and will therefore make criticizing the IRGC 
or enacting policies contrary to its will, “even more difficult.” </p>
<p>This cooling of political will to challenge the IRGC may already be 
evident in the reaction of President Rouhani and many prominent 
reformists to the U.S. designation. <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/5151810/iran-revolutionary-guard-us-terrorism-label/">Most</a> reformist legislators, publications and activists <a href="https://twitter.com/golnarM/status/1115489423377014784/">came</a>
 to the Guards defense, despite previous criticisms of the IRGC or 
attacks the Guards have made against them in the past. For example, 
Reformist <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/04/iran-irgc-fto-designation-fatf-bills-expediency-council.html#ixzz5lT8oPtZr">Abdollah Ramezanzadeh</a>,
 who served five years as a political prisoner, wrote that despite his 
“disagreements” with the IRGC, he will support them against 
“unreasonable” U.S. policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hardline conservatives in Iran are <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/04/iran-irgc-fto-designation-fatf-bills-expediency-council.html#ixzz5lTEt4MXY">already</a>
 using the designation to push their agenda and smear opponents. 
Conservative legislators are calling for the rejection of a series of 
bills passed by the pro-reform Parliament in late-2018 which would 
strengthen measures against money laundering and terror financing in 
Iran. The bills are being considered by the Expediency Council, which 
steps in when the Parliament and the Guardian Council, the other body 
whose approval is required to pass legislation, fail to agree. 
Conservatives <a href="https://www.alef.ir/news/3980120179.html">say</a>
 that no concessions, or anything resembling concession, should be made 
to the U.S. now that it has targeted the IRGC. They also accuse the 
bills’ proponents of being American allies. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/04/trump-netanyahu-israel-election-gift-irgc-iran.html">Meir Javedanfar</a>,
 Middle East analyst at the University of Haifa pushes back on this 
idea, arguing that recent reformist and moderate expressions of support 
for the IRGC are “photo-ops” and that their solidarity with the Guards 
is “unlikely to last in the long term.” He adds that given the 
“fundamental” nature of their disagreements, and those of their 
supporters, with the IRGC over economic and foreign policy issues, 
moderates’ and reformists’ willingness to confront the Guards may 
rebound in time. </p>
<p>· Armed U.S.-Iran Conflict</p>
<p>Perhaps the most prevalent concern among experts about the fallout 
from the designation is that it has increased the likelihood of military
 conflict between Iran and the United States.</p>
<p>Former United Nations spokeswoman and Middle East expert Dr. <a href="https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/provoking-the-iranian-revolutionary-guard-makes-us-less-safe-25871">Massoumeh Torfeh</a>,
 notes that since the designation, rhetoric from IRGC officers and other
 Iranian officials towards the U.S. has become far more militant. 
Foreign Minister <a href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2019/04/12/1987154/zarif-holds-us-accountable-for-consequences-of-anti-irgc-adventurism">Zarif</a>,
 for example, at the UN, warned that Iran will impose “dire 
consequences” on the “U.S. regime…as well as two or three puppet 
regimes” for the designation. Also, the Chief of Staff of Iran’s regular
 army threatened that if American troops in the region “make a mistake,”
 his forces will “confront them vigorously." Torfeh adds that because of
 the ballistic missiles and “elaborate network of operatives,” the IRGC 
has, it and its allies, are more than capable of attacking U.S. forces 
in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and the Persian Gulf. </p>
<p>For her part, Atlantic Council scholar <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-warn-irgc-terror-designation-could-inflame-us-iran-tensions-/4879193.html">Barbara Slavin</a>
 doubts that Iran’s direct response will go beyond the heated rhetoric. 
However, she does fear that the IRGC may strike U.S. forces through 
allied militant groups in Afghanistan and Syria. AIC’s President Dr. <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-warn-irgc-terror-designation-could-inflame-us-iran-tensions-/4879193.html">Hooshang Amirahmadi</a>,
 shares this concern about the IRGC’s allies, noting that some have 
already assumed combat positions near the Iranian border and that “the 
risk of confrontation” with U.S. forces has been brought “to a higher 
level” by the designation. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AliVaez/status/1115354840597716993">Ali Vaez</a>,
 Iran Project director for the International Crisis Group argues that 
the designation may well be designed by the Trump administration to 
provoke a militant response from the IRGC or its allies against U.S. 
forces, which would then give Washington a “casus belli,” or 
justification, for conflict with Iran. Former Obama administration 
adviser <a href="https://twitter.com/brhodes/status/1115275547746033664">Ben Rhodes</a> agrees, writing that designating the IRGC as a terror group “only makes sense as a step toward conflict.” </p>
<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/concerns-trump-administration-laying-legal-groundwork-military-action/story?id=62360052">Tess Bridgeman</a>
 argues that regardless of how Iran responds, the Trump administration 
may intend to strike Iran in the near future and use designation to 
claim justification under the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force 
Act (AUMF). She notes that that in comments on their reasoning for the 
designation, State Department officials, including Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo, have been stressing the IRGC’s role in supporting al-Qaeda 
operatives in the past. The AUMF <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/363182-heres-why-authorization-to-use-military-force-is-so-important">permits</a>
 the U.S. President to use military force against any “nations, 
organizations, or persons” that had any role in carrying out the 9/11 
terror attacks or harbored anyone who did. These concerns are shared by 
Senator <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rand-paul-slams-pompeo-over-potential-war-against-iran-says-admin-doesnt-have-authority">Rand Paul</a>
 (R-KY), who said that he was troubled by the Trump administration’s 
refusal to unequivocally state that the AUMF does not justify a strike 
on Iran. </p>
<p>Some conservative analysts, it should be noted, have pushed back on 
the idea that the designation could lead to armed conflict. Dr. <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-warn-irgc-terror-designation-could-inflame-us-iran-tensions-/4879193.html">Alireza Nourizadeh</a>,
 head of the London-based Center for Iranian and Arab Studies, argues 
that concern over military escalation is overblown because, despite its 
rhetoric, the IRGC, he contends, is under no illusions that it is “in a 
position to do any harm to the U.S.” Nor, according to Nourizadeh, is it
 willing to actually provoke the Trump administration into going to war.
 He cites the decreasing occurrence of incidents of harassment of U.S. 
Navy warships in the Persian Gulf by IRGC speed boats since President 
Trump, who had pledged to have the boats destroyed, took office as 
evidence. </p>
<p>As to the IRGC using its militant allies to attack U.S. forces in the region, Jerusalem Post analyst <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-trump-s-wise-necessary-strike-against-iran-s-top-export-international-terrorism-1.7108777">Sean Durns</a>
 notes that these groups have “been threatening, and murdering U.S. 
personnel for decades” before the designation. He cites recent data from
 the Pentagon which blame IRGC allies for over 600 U.S. military deaths 
in Iraq and argues that the U.S. cannot allow threats of violence to 
determine its foreign policy. </p>
<p>None </p>
<p>In the end, only time can truly tell what impact the U.S. designation
 of the IRGC will ultimately have. There is a very real possibility that
 nothing will change. Most experts do not believe that it will cause any
 significant shift in Iran’s foreign policy or the IRGC’s regional 
activities, as terror group designation adds few restrictions to the 
IRGC which were not already imposed by older sanctions. Also, despite 
his own concerns about rising US-Iran tension, AIC President <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-warn-irgc-terror-designation-could-inflame-us-iran-tensions-/4879193.html">Hooshang Amirahmadi</a>
 notes that there are many groups on the U.S.’ terror list against which
 Washington has never taken significant military action, including 
Hezbollah in Lebanon. </p>
