<p class="rm-manual">HYPED</p>
<p class="rm-manual">John Bolton and other Team Trump hawks are 
trumpeting intelligence that Tehran is readying attacks on U.S. forces. 
They’re exaggerating the threat, officials tell The Daily Beast.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the National Security Council announced that the U.S. was 
sending a carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Persian 
Gulf in response to “troubling and escalatory” warnings from Iran—an 
eye-popping move that raised fears of a potential military confrontation
 with Tehran. Justifying the move, anonymous government officials cited 
intelligence indicating Iran had <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-deployment-triggered-by-intelligence-warning-of-iranian-attack-plans-11557180106">crafted plans</a>
 to use proxies to strike U.S. forces, both off the coast of Yemen and 
stationed in Iraq. National Security Adviser John Bolton also discussed 
the intelligence on the record. A consensus appeared to be emerging: 
that Iran was gearing up for war.</p>
<p>But multiple sources close to the situation told The Daily Beast that
 the administration blew it out of proportion, characterizing the threat
 as more significant than it actually was. </p>
<p>“It’s not that the administration is mischaracterizing the 
intelligence, so much as overreacting to it,” said one U.S. government 
official briefed on it. </p>
<p>Another source familiar with the situation agreed that the Trump 
administration’s response was an “overreaction” but didn’t dispute that a
 threat exists. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-the-iranian-general-taunting-trump-on-a-us-hit-list">Gen. Qasem Soleimani</a>—the
 head of the Quds Force, Iran’s covert action arm—has told proxy forces 
in Iraq that a conflict with the U.S. will come soon, this source noted.
 </p>
<p>“I would characterize the current situation as shaping operations on 
both sides to tilt the field in preparation for a possible coming 
conflict,” continued the second source, who is also a U.S. government 
official. “The risk is a low-level proxy unit miscalculating and 
escalating things. We’re sending a message with this reaction to the 
intelligence, even though the threat might not be as imminent as 
portrayed.” </p>
<p>“ We’re sending a message with this reaction to the intelligence, 
even though the threat might not be as imminent as portrayed. ”</p>
<p>— U.S. official</p>
<p>The source added that the administration’s steps are a way to tell 
the Iranian government that the U.S. will hold them responsible for 
their surrogates’ actions. </p>
<p>A third U.S. government official close to the situation described the
 administration’s response this way: “It is meant to send a clear 
message and remove any ambiguity from a tense situation. We’re 
demonstrating the overwhelming capability we can bring to the region.”</p>
<p>Iran’s specific intentions may be a subject of debate, but there’s 
little doubt that it has the capability to hit U.S. forces through <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/iraqs-most-fearsome-shia-militia-leader-speaks-out">proxy groups</a>,
 as the Quds Force demonstrated with lethal efficiency during the Iraq 
war. According to the State Department, Iranian-backed militants in Iraq
 killed an estimated 603 U.S. troops between 2003 and 2011, many of them
 the result of armor-piercing explosively formed projectiles supplied by
 the Quds Force. </p>
<p>The Daily Beast has not reviewed the intelligence itself, which is 
all but certain to be classified. That means that the characterization 
of the intel—both on the record and anonymously—is crucial. And in this 
case, there is not a consensus in intelligence and military circles on 
whether the administration’s interpretation, used to justify the 
deployment of an addition U.S. aircraft carrier and Air Force bomber 
task force to the Gulf, was accurate. </p>
<p>The interpretation of intelligence, particularly on Iran, can often 
provoke disagreements within the national security bureaucracy. In 2007,
 a National Intelligence Estimate concluded with “high confidence” that 
“Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program” in 2003, prompting a 
controversy over the language used in its top line judgments and fury 
from those who saw Iran’s public enrichment of nuclear weapons fuel and 
development of ballistic missiles as a key part of its program. </p>
<p>A senior administration official insisted the Iranian threat 
intelligence in this case was strong, and said officials in the office 
of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obama-to-pick-joint-chiefs-head">Gen. Joseph Dunford</a>,
 chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, drafted the statement and sent 
it to NSC specifically asking for Bolton to approve it and that it go 
out from the White House, rather than the Department of Defense, to 
highlight the threat’s significance.</p>
<p>President Trump signaled a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/aipacs-ovation-for-trump-is-not-at-all-surprising">harsher line</a>
 on Iran even before he took office. On the campaign trail, Trump 
pledged to “totally dismantle Iran’s global terror network” and once in 
office his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, used his <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-flynn-and-team-trump-fire-a-warning-shot-at-iran">inaugural press briefing</a> to declare that Tehran was “on notice.” </p>
<p>Flynn’s successor, H.R. McMaster, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/mcmaster-rushes-to-save-the-iran-nuke-deal">broke with the president</a>
 on his uncompromising attitude towards the Islamic Republic, but with 
the appointment of John Bolton has come a more hawkish return to form.</p>
<p>When militants <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/leaked-audio-shows-an-iranian-gambit-to-control-iraq-failing">fired mortars</a>
 at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Baghdad in September 2018, the White
 House released a statement saying that it would “hold the regime in 
Tehran accountable” for any attack that injured U.S. personnel, and 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/09/286317.htm">cited an</a>
 “increasing and specific threats and incitement to attack our personnel
 and facilities in Iraq” while announcing the relocation of diplomats in
 Iraq. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Wall Street Journal reported, Bolton alarmed Defense Department officials by asking military planners to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-sought-options-to-strike-iran-11547375404">present options</a> for a possible strike on Iran in response to the incident. </p>
<p>A strike never came but tension between the Trump administration and 
Iran, already strained after the U.S. walked away from the U.S.-Iran 
nuclear agreement, has only increased. In recent weeks, the 
administration has <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/brian-hook-is-trumps-point-man-on-iran-and-under-investigation">ratcheted up sanctions</a> on the Islamic Republic even further, announcing that it will no longer <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-to-end-oil-waivers-to-drive-irans-exports-down-to-zero">grant waivers</a>
 to countries allowing them to buy Iranian crude oil without risk of 
U.S. sanctions and designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
(IRGC) as a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-designates-irans-revolutionary-guard-corps-as-terrorist-organization">foreign terrorist organization</a>. </p>
<p>Sources told The Daily Beast that the administration’s decision to 
designate the Iranian IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization in April 
likely escalated the tensions that precipitated the showdown that 
unfurled over the weekend. </p>
<p>In response, Iranian officials have recently hinted that they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/world/middleeast/iran-trump-nuclear-deal.html">walk away from</a>
 commitments made under the nuclear deal to limit enrichment of uranium 
fuel—a key component necessary in the production of nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>Despite the apparent intelligence indicating an increased risk to U.S. interests in Iraq, Secretary of State Pompeo made a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-pays-surprise-visit-to-iraq-amid-tensions-with-iran">surprise visit</a>
 to the country on Tuesday. Pompeo would not offer details on the 
intelligence about an Iranian threat but said, “This would be an effort 
to take American forces out that continue our campaign against ISIS, 
something that’s incredibly important to the Iraqi Government.”</p>
<p>Afshon Ostovar, an assistant professor at the Naval Postgraduate 
School who studies Iran and the IRGC, said that Iranian leaders have 
focused on trying to wait out the Trump administration, but that 
pressure campaign waged by the White House has led to some internal 
tension over the policy.</p>
<p>“I suspect that there are some in Iran, particularly some among the 
IRGC, that would like to push back now. However, it seems that Iran’s 
leaders are continuing to stress patience,” Ostovar said. “Yet every 
time pressure on Iran increases through additional sanctions, rhetoric, 
or posturing, I suspect the patience of Iran’s leaders, and their 
ability to hold back those that advocate retribution against the US, 
grows thinner.”</p>
<p>When Bolton took the unusual step of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/bolton-us-deploying-carrier-strike-group-bomber-task-force-to-middle-east-to-send-message-to-iran">announcing</a>
 that the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and an Air Force 
bomber task force were headed to the Gulf, he said that the movement was
 in response to “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and 
warnings.” </p>
<p>But one congressional aide cast doubt on the claim that intelligence 
alone had driven the deployments. The administration, the source told 
The Daily Beast, was “pivoting off posture moves already underway to 
respond to what they interpret as real risk in the intelligence 
reporting.”</p>
<p>Still, the aggressive messaging, meant to dissuade Iran from 
unleashing its proxies on the U.S., could end up backfiring, the aide 
told The Daily Beast. “Even if you view it as non-escalatory or in the 
‘escalate to de-escalate’ school (where a tough message is essential to 
walk things back) it’s taking place in an environment of increased 
pressure, including the IRGC designation. That context matters.”</p>
