<p>South Korea's spy agency believes North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, 
who recently dropped out of public view for nearly six weeks, had 
surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.</p>
<p>The intelligence, shared by the National Intelligence Service (NIS) 
in a legislators briefing on Tuesday, suggested that a cyst had been 
found in Mr Kim's ankle joint back in May.</p>
<p>Foreign medical experts were flown to Pyongyang to carry out an 
operation to remove the cyst sometime in September or October, the 
agency said.</p>
<p>Mr Kim dropped out of sight after attending a music concert with his wife in early September.</p>
<p>His prolonged and unexplained absence fuelled rampant speculation 
about his health and even rumours of a coup in the nuclear-armed state.</p>
<p>He finally reappeared in mid-October, with state media showing him 
using a walking stick as he conducted a series on inspection visits to 
new residential complexes in Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Competing theories for his absence had ranged widely from an extended
 rest period to a leadership coup, via a long list of possible illnesses
 and ailments including broken ankles, gout and diabetes.</p>
<p>Mr Kim, a heavy smoker, has shown striking weight gain since coming 
to power and TV footage just prior to his "disappearance" had shown him 
walking with a pronounced limp.</p>
<p>The NIS intelligence suggested that Mr Kim's weight problem could hamper his recovery from ankle surgery.</p>
<p>The NIS also says it has information that Mr Kim has demoted around 
200 military officers and that 50 executions have been carried out in 
the North so far this year.</p>
<p>Of the 50 executions carried out this year, the NIS said a number 
were related to an ongoing purge of those close to Mr Kim's uncle and 
one-time political mentor Jang Song-Thaek.</p>
<p>Mr Jang was executed last December on charges of treason and corruption.</p>
<p>On the demotion of the 200 military officers, the NIS said the 
apparent reason was under-performance in strategic artillery drills.</p>
