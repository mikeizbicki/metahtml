<p><span>A</span> Gulf War veteran and journalist said that he was not upset “a damn bit” that the United States <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/irans-infamous-shadow-general-qassem-soleimani-killed-in-air-strike">killed Qassem Soleimani</a>. </p>
<p>Mike Glenn, a reporter for the Washington Times who served as an 
officer during the Gulf War, condemned Soleimani and his attacks on the 
United States in a viral tweet on Friday. </p>
<p>“I'm a reporter but I was a Soldier for several years and led a 
platoon of cavalry troops into combat in Iraq,” Glenn said. “Qassim 
Solemani was directly responsible for the deaths of scores of American 
military personnel in Iraq. </p>
<p>“I'm not sad that he got greased. Not a damn bit,” Glenn added. </p>

<p>Soleimani, 62, was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/irans-infamous-shadow-general-qassem-soleimani-killed-in-air-strike">killed in a U.S. drone strike</a> in Baghdad on Friday, along with Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, who led the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Forces. </p>
<p>Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of more than 600 U.S. troops
 during the Iraq War as the commander of the Quds Force, a branch of the
 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps responsible for special operations in
 other countries.</p>
