<h2 class="rm-manual"> But Iran’s Ambassador to India Ali Chegeni denies allegation that Soleimani was behind terror attacks. </h2>
<p>India got caught in the crossfire between the United States and Iran after President Donald Trump blamed assassinated <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/who-is-general-qasem-soleimani-and-why-was-he-so-popular/article30467687.ece">Iranian General Qasem Soleimani </a>for a spate of terror attacks, including one in Delhi, a charge Iran’s envoy to India has denied.</p>
<p>In a statement in Washington, Mr. Trump justified the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/watch-who-was-qasem-soleimani/article30472935.ece">killing of Mr. Soleimani </a>in
 a missile attack on his convoy outside the Baghdad airport, saying that
 the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) 
international operations or “Quds force” was responsible for several 
terror attacks and was planning more.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iranian-general-soleimani-contributed-to-terror-plots-in-delhi-trump/article30477207.ece">Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion</a>, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London,” Mr. Trump said.</p>
<h5 class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/watch-who-was-qasem-soleimani/article30472935.ece"> Watch | Who was Qasem Soleimani? </a> </h5>
<p>Iran’s Ambassador to India Ali Chegeni denied the allegations. “Mr. 
Trump can say anything he likes, he can give any list of attacks that he
 likes. But this is a big lie. General Soleimani was a soldier, he was 
not involved in the targetting of innocents anywhere,” Mr. Chegeni said 
in an interview to The Hindu.</p>
<p>The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s 
statement, which brought New Delhi into the rising tensions between 
Washington and Tehran.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump is believed to have referred to the car bombing of an 
Israeli diplomat in Delhi in February 2012. The diplomat, who was also 
the wife of the Israeli defence attaché, was injured in the attack along
 with three others. At the time, the Delhi Police’s special cell that 
investigated the case believed it was connected with attacks on Israeli 
diplomats in Tbilisi, Georgia as well as Bangkok, Thailand, and was 
reportedly carried out by IRGC agents at the time in retaliation for 
attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists. Delhi Police officials say the 
case has not moved since 2013, when the lone suspect, an Indian 
journalist with an Iranian news agency, was granted bail, a decision 
that was upheld in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Mr. Chegeni said that by raising the issue, Mr. Trump was attempting 
to cover the U.S.’s action in killing the Iranian official while he was 
visiting Iraq after travelling to Syria for “anti-terrorism 
consultations”.</p>
<p>“Gen Soleimani fought against the ISIS, Jubhat Al Nusra, Al-Qaeda. He
 was invited to Syria and Iraq by their governments for advice and 
assistance on fighting these terror groups. So anyone who assassinated 
him, is for the terrorists. And if this was ordered by their President, 
as the U.S. says, then this is an act of state terrorism,” he noted.</p>
<h2>New Delhi expresses concern</h2>
<p>On Friday, India issued a statement that expressed concern over 
rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and “noted” the U.S.’s 
killing of the senior Iranian official.</p>
<p>When asked, Mr. Chegeni said he expected India would also “condemn 
the assassination of an official who was on a visit to another country 
on official invitation.”</p>

<p>He stated,“We expect India as our reliable friend to advise the 
United States to follow international norms and not destabilise the 
region. We have the right to retaliate, but Iranians are patient, we 
will choose the time and place of our response to this killing.”</p>
<p>Tougher language is expected from Iranian Foreign Minister Javad 
Zarif, who is due in Delhi on January 14 to address the Raisina 
dialogue. The 3-day event, where U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor 
Matt Pottinger will also speak, could see India, which has attempted a 
“tightrope walk” in ties with both countries, caught in the middle 
again.</p>
