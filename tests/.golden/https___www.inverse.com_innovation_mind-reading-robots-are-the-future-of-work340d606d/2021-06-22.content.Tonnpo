<p>Robots arenâ€™t coming for <a href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/59796-robots-ai-jobs-interview-bias">your jobs</a> â€” theyâ€™re coming for your brains. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ae.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=hkj5117" rel="noreferrer">Houtan Jebelli</a> of Penn State, it could be the future of work. </p>
<p>Jebelli, an assistant professor of engineering, and his team are taking advantage of new advances in <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/52812-brain-computer-interface-translates-thoughts-to-speech">brain-computer interfaces</a> to create a sort of cybernetic workforce. <a href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/arnelle-etienne-young-innovators">Using EEG</a>
 embedded directly into construction workersâ€™ hard hats, the team has 
devised a way for robots to read the minds of their human co-workers and
 adjust their work accordingly. </p>
<p>â€œThis is probably the future of human-machine interaction, especially in field-oriented industries,â€ Jebelli says.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://research.abo.fi/en/persons/johnny-l%C3%A5ngstedt" rel="noreferrer">Johnny LÃ¥ngstedt</a>, a doctoral candidate in comparative religion at Ã bo Akademi University with a research focus on business, tells Inverse that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10301763.2021.1886624" rel="noreferrer">recent research</a>
 of his suggests that this type of automation may also create just as 
many problems as it attempts to solve, particularly when it comes to 
workplace satisfaction.</p>
<p>â€œWe're motivated by a certain set of value priorities,â€ 
LÃ¥ngstedt explains to Inverse, such as creativity or order. â€œAnd 
those [values] drive our actions and interpretations of different 
situations, and also affect which occupations we choose to work in.â€ 
Automation changing what values our jobs hold, for example going from 
monotonous to more creative, is where the trouble begins, he says.</p>
<p>The emotional intelligence this EEG technology is attempting to 
create walks the line between WALL-E-like endearment and Orwellian 
panoptic control, but like any modernizing workplace technology, itâ€™s 
coming for us whether we like it or not. </p>
<h2>What is human-robot collaboration?</h2>
<p>The narrative of workplace automation often dictates that robots or 
machines will replace humans in the workforce in fields ranging from 
assembly lines and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/robot-can-help-you-untangle-your-hair-0505" rel="noreferrer">hair salons</a> to the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/5g-telesurgery-is-here">operating room</a>.
 But human-robot collaboration (HRC) offers a different viewpoint and 
proposes that new workplace technology (particularly, robots) will 
instead <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/54100-working-with-robots-self-esteem">work alongside humans</a>, like co-workers.</p>
<p>This is particularly prevalent, write the Penn State researchers in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580521000078" rel="noreferrer">their study</a>
 published in the journal Automation in Construction this April, in 
fields like construction where thereâ€™s little opportunity for robotic 
workers and human workers to work separately from one another. To 
accomplish dynamic tasks, like laying brick, itâ€™s more likely that 
human workers and robots will have to work together.</p>
<blockquote>â€œI believe our proposed technology might be powerful for the future.â€</blockquote>
<p>But this is much easier said than done says Jebelli, especially 
because building trust between humans and robots can be a difficult 
task. </p>
<p>â€œWhen it comes to human-robot collaboration, building that trust, 
and even providing [HRC] training for the workers is very important,â€ 
says Jebelli. Otherwise, it can be easy to misinterpret the intentions 
of your robot companion, he explains.</p>
<p>Human workers may get annoyed at each other when a task goes south, 
but this is amplified if their co-worker is a robot because thereâ€™s 
little opportunity to understand or discuss why different choices were 
made, e.g. speeding through a detail-oriented task.</p>
<p>Creating a â€œhuman-in-the-loopâ€ system for these robots that can 
help them better understand and meet the needs of their human co-workers
 will be essential to building this trust, says Jebelli. And thatâ€™s 
exactly what they set out to do when they stuck an EEG cap inside a 
bunch of hardhats a let participants loose with a team of robot workers.</p>
<p>HOW DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK?</p>
<p>The Penn State team developed an HRC framework that used EEG data 
collected from participants as input for robots to help them interpret 
the cognitive load of their human coworkers.</p>
<p>The framework worked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>EEG data was collected via the lined hard hats and then digitally 
â€œcleanedâ€ of excess electrical noise (e.g. eye blinking or nearby 
electronics) explains <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yizhi-liu-0235891a9/" rel="noreferrer">Yizhi Liu</a>, the studyâ€™s first author and a Penn State doctoral student</li>
<li>A machine-learning algorithm then processed the data to find distinct stress patterns</li>
<li>These patterns were then characterized when the worker had an increased, decreased, or steady cognitive load</li>
<li>The robot would then react accordingly, either slowing down, 
speeding up, or keeping its pace steady to accommodate for the worker</li>
</ul>
<p>One interesting problem to overcome for this team was how to separate
 general stress from work stress to ensure the robot was receiving 
up-to-date cognitive load information. To account for this, Jebelli says
 they first established baseline EEG stress levels by having the 
participants wear the EEG-lined hardhats for a few minutes at the 
beginning of the trial.</p>
<p>â€œFor example, assume I had a bad weekend... like I got a rejection 
for one of my proposals or something like that,â€ says Jebelli. â€œWhen
 I go to the job site, this will be added to the daily stress. This is 
something that our framework will consider.â€</p>
<p>In the case of the brick-laying robot analyzed in the study, the 
robot can use this information to adjust its pace accordingly, explains a
 co-author on the student and Penn State post-doctoral scholar, <a href="https://www.ae.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=mjh6946" rel="noreferrer">Mahmoud Habibnezhad</a>.</p>
<p>â€œWhen the robot changes its performance the worker understands 
[why],â€ says Habibnezhad. â€œThe worker [can] understand that this 
robot is slowing down because heâ€™s tired ... That instills trust over 
time.â€</p>
<p>The authors write that this approach had over an 80 percent accuracy 
rate when it came to appropriately making these corrections.</p>
<p>WHY DO HUMANS WANT THIS?</p>
<p>Dynamic jobs like construction are not only physically demanding but can be dangerous as well. In 2017, construction jobs <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf" rel="noreferrer">experienced 971 fatalities</a> in the U.S., the highest death rate for the industry in a decade. </p>
<blockquote>â€œYou would probably see a decline in job satisfaction and 
engagement since the job doesn't really fulfill [their] basic needs.â€</blockquote>
<p>Collaborative automation of this industry cannot only relieve some of
 the physical work, argue the authors, but can also account for 
instances where mental stress may have led to poor or dangerous 
decisions as well.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS?</p>
<p>Yet despite its potential benefits, this technology is not without 
its ethical faults or repercussions. In particular, do workers really 
want to give access to their thoughts to robots, let alone their bosses?</p>
<p>For now, Jebelli says that there are guidelines in place to prevent 
tampering, including anonymizing worker data, but says itâ€™s a concern 
to keep on top of.</p>
<p>There is also a possibility, however, that this kind of automation 
will fundamentally change how workers appreciate their job, argues 
LÃ¥ngstedt. </p>
<p>While not commenting on this study directly, LÃ¥ngstedtâ€™s <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10301763.2021.1886624" rel="noreferrer">study</a>,
 published this February in the journal Labour &amp; Industry found 
after analyzing a European Survey of over 126 occupations that 
automating away rote or repetitive tasks in a workplace and lead to 
worker dissatisfaction as the value they found in the job initially 
(e.g. order, repetition) may be erased.</p>
<p>â€œYou would probably see a decline in job satisfaction and 
engagement since the job doesn't really fulfill [their] basic needs,â€ 
explains LÃ¥ngstedt. There may be ways to lessen this blow, he suggests 
in the study, such as teaching children to value creativity more in 
school, but there will inevitably be a lag between automation and these 
potential corrections.</p>
<p>WHEN WILL IT AFFECT THE FUTURE?</p>
<p>Jebelli says there isnâ€™t yet a hard deadline for when this kind of 
mind-reading technology will hit the workplace in earnest, but he says 
that itâ€™s probably less than a decade away and could be used in 
workplaces beyond construction, even perhaps <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580520311031" rel="noreferrer">on the ISS</a> one day.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he says that this kind of technology isnâ€™t looking to 
erase human workers, but instead work with them to create a safer 
workplace.</p>
<p>â€œThe robot by itself it's not even performing the job,â€ says 
Jebelli. â€œIt always requires at least one or two workers [to help]... 
And as there is a need for better human-robot work collaboration, I 
believe our proposed technology might be powerful for the future.â€</p>
