<p>The dictator spoke of the importance of the country's submarine units as he visited the North Korean Navy Unit 167 </p>
<p>The paper said Kim called for the crew on the submarine to 'devote 
their wisdom and enthusiasm to rounding off the combat preparations'. </p>
<p>The dictator also reportedly led a navy drill and even taught 
'navigation methods' to the submarine's captain, according to the Korean
 Central News Agency, as cited by the South's <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2014/06/16/8/0401000000AEN20140616001651315F.html">Yonhap News Agency</a>. </p>

which Yonhap said is believed to be part of the South Hamgyong 
Province-based East Sea fleet command.</h6> <p>That the pictures would reveal the submarine to be in such a condition has surprised North Korea expert Aidan Foster-Carter. </p>
<p>He told <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/10903025/Are-North-Koreas-submarine-photographs-faked.html">The Telegraph</a>: 'To see rust in a North Korean picture is quite surprising. Normally they tart stuff up.' </p>

<p>According to the KCNA, during the visit to the submarine the dictator
 said: 'The commanding officers and seamen should clearly see through 
the motives of the hateful enemies watching for a chance to invade our 
land and put spurs to combat preparations, thinking about battles only.'
 </p>
<p>It was reported last week the dictator inspected the Ryo Islet 
Defense Detachment - a vast military base responsible for protecting the
 island of Ryodo and the coastal city of Wonsan. </p>
<p>Wonson is an area of particular strategic importance to Kim because on its outskirts lies his favourite luxury holiday home. </p> <p>+8 </p>
<p>Patches of rust can be seen in the pictures of the green vessel,

<p>Kim was quoted as saying: 'The Party Central Committee is attaching great importance to the combined units of submarines' </p>
<p>'[The outpost] is an important combat mission of the detachment to 
definitely turn the islet into an impregnable fortress and unsinkable 
battleship and thus not to allow enemies to invade the socialist 
homeland,' state-run news agancy KCNA said. </p>
<p>The young leader and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, have 
frequently visited the vacation home and last year ordered the creation 
of the nation's first beach resort in the city. </p>
<p>Kim praised the military detachment for successfully doing 
'everything the Party Central Committee considered as good,' while also 
saying that it is 'a model unit where the party's military policy is 
being most correctly implemented and a typical one for the whole army to
 learn from,' according to the report. </p>
<h3>Kim Jong-un's playboy half brother enjoys spaghetti in Jakarta amid concerns of assassination attempt by North Koreans</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Kim Jong-nam posed for photos with chef at Italian restaurant in Jakarta</p> </li>
<li> <p>He has been moving around South East Asia amid assassination concerns</p> </li>
<li> <p>Kim 'disappeared' after his uncle Jang Song-taek was executed last year </p>
</li>
</ul> <p>He has been moving from city to city in South East Asia keeping
 his eyes and ears open for any attempt by North Korean agents to 
assassinate him. </p>
<p>But Kim Jong-nam, the elder half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim 
Jong-un, has daringly stepped out into the public gaze in Indonesia - 
and tucked into a dish of 'spag-bol' in an Italian restaurant in 
Jakarta. </p>
<p>He even wrapped a burly arm around the chef's shoulders as they posed
 for a photo, but the chef was so concerned about his own safety that he
 asked for his face to be obscured. </p> <p>+2 </p>
<p>Kim Jong-nam, the elder half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim 
Jong-un, poses for a photo with the chef of an Italian restaurant in 
Jakarta earlier this month </p>
<p>Kim looked every part the aging playboy he is reputed to be as he 
brazenly grinned into the camera with his dangling sunglasses and straw 
hat. </p>
<p>Happy to shake off memories of bibimbap - a common North Korean dish 
of rice, vegetables and occasionally eggs and meat - Kim is said to have
 consumed his Italian meal with great relish in the upmarket restaurant.
 </p>
<p>The photo was acquired by South Korea's YTN television network from a friend of Kim's. </p>
<p>‘Despite reports that Kim Jong-nam's safety was in question following
 the execution of his uncle, Jang Song-taek, he is still alive and 
well,' said a source close to the family. </p>
<p>'He's living the same lavish lifestyle, moving around between Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and France.' </p>
<p>He has been seen in the casinos of Macau and slipping into fine-dining restaurants throughout South East Asia. </p>
<p>But he is said to be aware that his life remains in constant danger 
because he criticised the King Jong-un regime and he made sure he 
'disappeared' following the execution of Jang last December. </p>
<p>Another source claims that a North Korean agent had tried to 
assassinate Kim Jong-nam in Macau in 2011, but failed after a bloody 
shootout with his bodyguards. He fled to another city. </p>
<p>Since then, he has lived the life of a wandering playboy and when he 
visited the Italian restaurant - which is owned by a Japanese 
businessman - he was accompanied by an attractive woman aged in her 
early 30s. </p> <p>+2 </p>
<p>Kim Jong-Nam has been moving from city to city in South East Asia 
amid concerns of an assassination attempt by North Korean agents </p>
<p>Until late 2011, when his father - former leader Kim Jong-il, who is 
also Kim Jong-un's father by a different mother - was still alive, 
Jong-nam shuffled back and forth between Beijing and Macau, where his 
first and second wives lived. </p>
<p>He is also known to have travelled to Thailand, Austria and Russia, 
stopping in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, from time to time. </p>
<p>But following the death of his father he disappeared from view, 
fearing the purges being carried out by his younger half-brother. </p>
<p>He has been able to live well, say North Korea watchers, thanks to 
benefits from building projects and trading companies set up by his 
executed uncle Jang Song-taek. </p>
<p>'It is possible that he believes he is not on the list of those to be
 purged by the current North Korean regime,' a source said. </p>
<p>'This is why he has happily posed for a photo in an Indonesian 
restaurant. But he would not have gone back there a second time - just 
in case.' </p>
<p>In fact, it is believed he has moved on from Jakarta since the picture was taken earlier this month. </p>
<p>He is said to be still on his guard, worried that his playboy 
lifestyle might have infuriated his younger half-brother, who had been 
angered by the 'worldliness and womanising' of Kim Jang-taek. </p>
<p>There is speculation that Beijing is watching Kim Jong-nam's back for
 him, with a pencilled-in plan to install him as leader of North Korea 
should the regime of Kim Jong-un collapse. </p>

Korean despot (pictured, left, crying at a memorial service for his

dream to plant a lot of trees </p>
<p>It was a marked change from the thunderous mood he was seen in last 
when he publicly scolded the national weather service for giving 
incorrect forecasts and using out-of-date equipment. </p>
<p>In a rare public dressing down of a government body, Kim urged the 
Hydro-meteorological Service to update its equipment and improve its 
work. </p>
<p>'There are many incorrect forecasts as the meteorological observation
 has not been put on a modern and scientific basis,' Kim said, telling 
the agency to 'fundamentally' improve its work and equipment. </p> <p>Kim
 Jong-Un has issued a rebuke to a government agency in North Korea, 
criticising the weather service for giving 'incorrect' forecasts and 
using out of date equipment </p> <p>+7 </p>
<p>Public criticism is rare in North Korea, with Kim usually keen to 
praise government agencies in an attempt to pass his regime off as a 
success </p>
<p>Accurate forecasts are needed to protect the 'lives and properties' 
of people from disasters caused by 'abnormal climatic phenomenon', he 
said. </p>
<p>Calling the weather service 'very important work directly affecting 
the overall economic affairs', Kim also underscored the need to 
'modernise meteorological observation equipment at a high level', KCNA 
said. </p>
<p>It was not clear when Kim visited the agency, but public criticism of
 government officials during field trips by North Korean leaders is 
extremely rare. </p>
<p>Usually Kim's official visits are marked by broad smiles and adoring 
crowds while Kim praises the work people are doing, in an attempt to 
pass his regime off as a success. </p>
<h3>Kim Jong-un has engineers behind deadly North Korean apartment collapse 'executed by firing squad'</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Leader Kim Jong-un 'unable to sleep' following tragedy in Pyongyang</p> </li>
<li> <p>More than 500 people, including members of the State Security 
Department, were believed to have been living in complex when it came 
down</p> </li>
<li> <p>Shoddy construction blamed as builders often sell materials on black market</p> </li>
<li> <p>Four engineers reportedly executed and military official sent to prison camp</p> </li>

</li>
</ul> <p>Kim Jong-un has rounded up the engineers and architects behind 
the deadly collapse of a North Korean apartment block and executed them 
by firing squad, it is claimed today. </p>
<p>More than 500 people, including high-ranking intelligence and police 
officials, are thought to have died when the 23-storey building crumbled
 in the capital, Pyongyang. </p>
<p>Kim, who was pictured touring a glass factory in photographs released
 today, was reportedly unable to sleep after learning of the tragedy 
last week, thought to have been caused by poor workmanship. </p>

<p>Action: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, pictured inspecting a glass 
factory, has reportedly had engineers behind an apartment block which 
collapsed executed </p> <p>+8 </p>
<p>Troubled: Kim Jong-un, pictured touring the factory in North Pyongan 
province, was reportedly unable to sleep after learning of the tragedy </p>
<p>According to a Japanese newspaper with sources in North Korea, the 
key officials and engineers behind the building of the apartment complex
 have been rounded up and handed down deadly or severe punishment. </p>
<p>Four design and construction engineers were executed by firing squad 
and a military official in charge of the project was sent to a prison 
camp, a source told the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper. One official has been 
photographed making a grovelling public apology to a large crowd near 
site of the collapse, which was then reported - unusually - by North 
Korea's official news agency. </p>
<p>But the photo was carefully shot so as not to include the debris from
 the collapse - instead it showed another apartment building close by. </p> <p>+8 </p>
<p>Punished: The key officials and engineers behind the building of the 
apartment complex have reportedly been rounded up and handed down deadly
 or severe punishment </p> <p>+8 </p>
<p>Deadly: Four design and construction engineers were executed by 
firing squad and a military official in charge of the project was sent 
to a prison camp, it is claimed </p> <p>+8 </p>
<p>Damage: The exact cause of the accident remains unclear, but shoddy 
construction is likely to be the cause as on-site directors and workers 
often smuggle away steel and cement to sell on the black market </p>
<p>The Japanese newspaper said that although the exact cause of the 
accident remains unclear, shoddy construction is likely to be the cause 
because on-site directors and workers often smuggle away steel and 
cement to sell on the black market. </p>
<p>Another Japanese newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, reported that the 
building was inhabited by top intelligence and police officials, which 
might account for Kim Jong-un's wrath. </p>
<p>The building is also thought to have housed a large number of elite 
members of the Workers Party, and although it had not been finished, 
residents had started moving in around late November because it is 
understood only some interior work remained to be completed. </p>
<p>At least 92 households were believed to be living in the apartment complex when it came down. </p>

<p>Location: A satellite photograph shows the building in the capital, 
Pyongyang, which is thought to have housed a large number of elite 
members of the Workers Party </p>
<p>Kim Jong-un has been known to order immediate death warrants against 
those who cause him serious grief, among them his uncle Jang Song-taek 
and members of his family, including children, it has been claimed by 
North Korean watchers. </p>
<p>The leader started an aggressive construction drive in the capital in
 2009, but the projects were plagued by a shortage of construction 
materials, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun. </p>
<p>However, Kim pressed workers to continue building, including working 
hard and fast to complete a vast ski resort earlier this year in the 
Masik Pass in the eastern mountains. </p>
<p>Photographs released by North Korea's official Korean Central News 
Agency today showed him inspecting the Taegwan Glass Factory in North 
Pyongan province. </p>
<p>Last month, satellite photos showed that the roof of a luxury villa 
belonging to leader Kim Jong-Un had collapsed, also due to faulty 
construction. </p> <p>+8 </p>
<p>High rise city: The block of flats was under construction but it is 
believed that many families had moved in before the block was completed </p>
<p>An American satellite image expert said the building appeared to be an aquarium that was built in 2011. </p>
<p>Kim Jong-Un had used material imported from Italy and Germany and had
 then filled it with £2 million worth of marine life including dolphins 
brought in from China. </p>
<p>North Korean defectors said that military engineers were responsible for building Kim's person villas. </p>
<p>A source told the South Korean newspaper: 'Once Kim Jong-un sets a completion date, there is no arguing. </p>
<p>'This frantic push to meet deadlines is everywhere causing problems with quality.' </p>

Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been in power for about two and a half 
years now, and the family tradition of "field guidance" trips shows no 
sign of abating. Kim Jong Un, like his father and grandfather before 
him, visits hospitals, factories, and military facilities, giving 
on-the-spot advice, which is dutifully recorded by the many note-takers 
in attendance at every event. Gathered here are just a few of the photos
 of these visits, released by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) over
 the past 12 months. [<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/06/kim-jong-uns-busy-year/100759/">31 photos</a>] </p>
