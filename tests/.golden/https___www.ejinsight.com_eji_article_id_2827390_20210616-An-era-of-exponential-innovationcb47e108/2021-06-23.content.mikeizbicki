<h1 class="rm-manual">An era of exponential innovation</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span><a href="file:///eji/author/id/14980" rel="author">Andy Brown</a></span> <span>June 16, 2021 08:40</span> </p>
<p>The Future is Faster than you Think. History will show this to be a 
hugely significant period. Businesses, industries and our ways of life 
are transforming. Many different forms of innovation are converging to 
drive this change.</p>
<p>We keep our belief in accelerating innovation in mind when we look 
for companies. It drives us to choose those that we think will benefit 
most from change in how we live, work, play, make, save and spend.</p>
<p>Take for example the exponential improvement in computing power. In 
1965, Gordon Moore (the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel)
 noticed that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles
 about every two years.</p>
<p>His observation (for it was never a physical law) has had profound 
consequences. For instance, let’s compare our smartphones to the 
computer that guided Apollo 11 to the moon over five decades ago. The 
former now have 100,000 times the processing power and 7 million times 
the memory of the latter (Kendall, 2019). Improvements in computing 
power are the engine of the present technological revolution. They are 
driving the emergence of new disciplines and approaches, such as 
biotechnology, genomics and quantum computing.</p>
<p>Although Moore’s law is well-known, it is a special case of an 
earlier and much broader law that was discovered by aerospace engineer 
Theodore Thomas Wright in 1936. Unlike Moore, who focused on time, 
Wright looked at units produced. Wright’s law states that each time 
production doubles, unit costs reduce by around 20%.</p>
<p>Wright’s law helps us make sense of how the future might look by 
forcing us to ask the question of which innovations follow its rule of 
thumb and which do not. As Fig 2 highlights, production costs for some 
key new technologies have reduced significantly over the past 50 years. 
Note the relatively flat lines for autos and traditional sources of 
energy, as compared to the sharp reductions in technological components 
and DNA sequencing. The outcome as the subsequent chart shows, has been 
that adoption rates of new technologies have accelerated over the past 
120 years.</p>
<p>To get our predictions of the future right, we ought to pay attention
 to those technologies that follow Moore’s and/or Wright’s law – the 
future belongs to them. To that end, we have backed structural winners 
such as Dutch semiconductor equipment company ASML. ASML is probably the
 most important company that most people have never heard of. After all,
 it is the key to Moore’s law continuing to apply.</p>
<p>The companies of the future</p>
<p>You may think theoretical physics is an unlikely source of investment
 ideas, but we have found the thinking of Geoffrey West of the Santa Fe 
Institute to be highly informative in framing how we think about the 
companies of the future. As West recognises in his highly lauded work 
Scale (2017), organisms, cities and businesses all have organic 
characteristics. They’re born, they grow, sometimes they shrink and, 
usually, they die.</p>
<p>Each category differs in the way it scales, however. Larger cities 
might benefit from the increased connections that size brings. So cities
 with bigger populations tend to have higher GDP per capita. Companies 
and organisms, on the other hand, tend to have sublinear growth 
characteristics. That is to say as they get bigger they get slower, less
 nimble and eventually die. This is undoubtedly true in most cases, but 
what if there are companies out there that defy this?</p>
<p>This is where we have learnt from the work of thinkers such as Brian 
Arthur. In 1997, he published an incredibly prescient article, 
Increasing Returns and the New World of Business. In the piece, Arthur 
makes the point that traditional understanding of how markets and 
businesses operate is based on an outdated concept. This is the 
“assumption of diminishing returns: products or companies that get ahead
 in a market eventually run into limitations.”</p>
<p>Yet western economies have transformed in the last century. Old 
characteristics, such as bulk processing and materials manufacturing, 
still exist, but information processing, the mainstay of new economies, 
is there in tandem. Arthur describes, “…economic behaviours shifting 
from ones of diminishing returns to ones of increasing returns…the 
tendency for that which is ahead to get further ahead, for that which 
loses advantage to lose further advantage”.</p>
<p>This makes sense because heavy R&amp;D-intensive industries tend to 
involve complex design processes. These are hard to replicate, resulting
 in lower unit costs as sales increase. Many of these future winners 
will exhibit network effects, or have high switching costs too which 
means they build very loyal customer relationships.</p>
<p>A non-traditional view of the world</p>
<p>We believe deep-seated changes will continue to disrupt traditional 
ways of doing business, and this will give rise to a narrower set of 
winners across all industries. In the decades to come, the companies 
that harness the power of new innovations to better serve customers will
 be the ones that we are talking about. As long-term active investors we
 feel lucky to live in a time of such great opportunity.</p>
