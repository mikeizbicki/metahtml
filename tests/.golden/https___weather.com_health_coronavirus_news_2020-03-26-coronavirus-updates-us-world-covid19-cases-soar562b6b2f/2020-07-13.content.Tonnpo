<h3>Heat Wave Could be Making Pandemic Worse</h3>
<p>Despite early hopes that summer would reduce the COVID-19 pandemic, 
cases are surging and the heat wave may be making things worse.</p>
<h3>At a Glance</h3>
<ul>
<li>With more than 83,000 cases, the U.S. has surpassed China and Italy.</li>
<li>A record number of people filed for unemployment in the U.S. this week.</li>
<li>Thousands of retired soldiers said they'd be interested in returning to active duty if needed.</li>
<li>The death toll in the U.S. topped 1,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of people infected with COVID-19 in the United States has 
surpassed all other countries, including China, the original epicenter 
of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>More than 83,000 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with the 
respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus as of Thursday 
evening, a staggering jump of more than 10,000 since the morning, 
according to data tracked by <a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">Johns Hopkins University</a> . At least 1,200 deaths have been blamed on the virus in the U.S.</p>
<p>China, where the crisis seems to have subsided, has reported 81,782 cases.</p>
<p>As cases of COVID-19 continued to climb, a record number of people in
 the nation filed for for unemployment, cities across the nation rolled 
out temporary field hospitals and the U.S. Army asked some former 
soldiers if they would consider returning to active duty to help fight 
the pandemic.</p>
<p>There have been more than 529,000 cases reported globally. Nearly 24,000 people have died and some 122,000 have recovered.</p>
<h3>Latest Developments</h3>
<p>United States</p>
<p>-The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it will <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/489753-epa-suspends-enforcement-of-environmental-laws-amid-coronavirus">suspend all environmental law enforcement</a>
 , according to the Hill. This means no companies will need to meet any 
federal environmental standards during the pandemic, the report added. 
The EPA did not say when it will begin enforcing environmental laws 
again.</p>
<p>-The Navy is working quickly to contain the spread of the virus 
aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, which is docked in Guam. According to
 USA Today, there have been <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/26/coronavirus-navy-test-all-sailors-roosevelt-cases-grow/2920634001/">23 confirmed cases</a> aboard the ship, which contains 5,000 sailors who live in extremely close quarters.</p>
<p>-Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced a shelter-in-place order for all residents from Saturday through April 10.</p>
<p>-Idaho and Delaware announced their first deaths from COVID-19. 
Deaths have now been reported in at least 42 states and the District of 
Columbia.</p>
<p>-Columbia University and New York University have both announced plans to allow medical students to graduate early.</p>
<p>-Hospitals across the country are rolling out temporary field 
hospitals, many with assistance from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
and the National Guard. Soldiers are building <a href="https://twitter.com/FEMA_Pete/status/1242921649965608961">four medical facilities </a>
 in the Javits Center in New York City as well as four other medical 
facilities in different parts of the state. Two similar facilities will 
also be placed in Seattle. The Corps is also assessing other potential 
sites in several states nationwide, and Navy hospital ships are 
preparing headed toward <a href="https://twitter.com/USNavy/status/1242874082670055424">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/USNavy/status/1242542973331570690">New York City</a> . </p>

<p>-A makeshift morgue was set up outside Bellevue Hospital in New York 
City, where the situation seems to grow more dire by the day. New York 
now has more than 33,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and at least 366 
deaths.</p>
<p>-The U.S. Army sent an email to retired soldiers Wednesday evening. 
The email said Army leaders were looking to "gauge the interest" of 
those "who would be willing to assist with the COVID-19 coronavirus 
pandemic response effort should their skills and expertise be required."
 The message specifically targeted those in the medical field, but said 
other skill sets would also be considered. The Army later said <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/army-covid-medics-rejoin">more than 9,000 retired soldiers</a> said they'd be willing to assist.</p>
<p>-More than <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-26-20-intl-hnk/index.html">100 employees</a> at three Boston hospitals have tested positive for COVID-19, according to CNN.</p>
<p class="">-The Senate voted unanimously Thursday morning to pass the 
aid bill, which will now go to the House for a vote as early as Friday. 
The bill provides for a one-time payment of $1,200 to single American 
adults who earn less than $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple 
making up to $150,000 and payments of $500 per child. It also includes 
emergency unemployment benefits, billions of dollars in loans and other 
aid to industry, state and local governments and small businesses as 
well as additional funding for the health care industry, including 
hospitals.</p>

<p>-More than 3 million people in the U.S. applied for unemployment 
benefits last week, four times the number of the previous record set in 
1982, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>-Alaska and South Dakota currently have the lowest number of 
confirmed cases in the U.S., with each reporting 41. New Jersey, 
California and Washington, in that order, follow New York with the most 
cases. Michigan and Florida follow as the next worst-hit states.</p>

buildings meant for use as a field hospital for coronavirus patients 
stand together on a soccer field in the Seattle suburb of Shoreline, 
Wash. With U.S. hospital capacity stretched thin, hospitals around the 
country are scrambling to find space for a coming flood of COVID-19 
patients, opening older closed hospitals and repurposing other 
buildings. </p>

<p class="">Worldwide</p>
<p>-Italy has closed most of its factories as it tries to stop the 
spread of coronavirus, the AP reported. Italy is so far the hardest-hit 
country outside of China, with more than 74,000 cases of COVID-19 and at
 least 7,500 deaths.</p>
<p>-Singapore reported its largest single day jump in cases, with the total now at 631.</p>
<p>-The death toll in Spain rose by another 650 people on Thursday. At least 4,089 have died there among some 56,000 infected. </p>
