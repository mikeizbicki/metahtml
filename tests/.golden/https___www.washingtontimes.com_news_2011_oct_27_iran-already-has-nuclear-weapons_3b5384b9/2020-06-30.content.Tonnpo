<p class="rm-manual"> <span> By Reza Kahlili </span> <span> - The Washington Times - Thursday, October 27, 2011 </span> </p>
<p class="">ANALYSIS/OPINION:</p>
<p>The pressure the United States and the West is bringing to bear on <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>
 to keep it from acquiring nuclear weapons is all for naught. Not only 
does the Islamic Republic already have nuclear weapons from the old <a href="file:///topics/soviet-union/">Soviet Union</a>, but it has enough enriched uranium for more. What’s worse, it has a delivery system.</p>
<p>The West for nearly a decade has worried about <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>’s uranium enhancement, believing <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> is working on a nuclear bomb, though the government maintains its uranium is only for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>When <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> began its nuclear program in the mid-1980s, I was working as a spy for the <a href="file:///topics/united-states-central-intelligence-agency/">CIA</a> within the Revolutionary <a href="file:///topics/guards/">Guards</a>. The <a href="file:///topics/guards/">Guards</a>‘
 intelligence at that time had learned of Saddam Hussein’s attempt to 
buy a nuclear bomb for Iraq. Guard commanders concluded that they needed
 a nuclear bomb because if Saddam were to get his own, he would use it 
against <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>. At that time, the two countries were at war.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="file:///news/2020/jun/29/china-pig-flu-strain-has-pandemic-potential-report/">Report: New China pig flu strain has pandemic potential</a> </p>
<p>Mohsen Rezaei, then-chief commander of the <a href="file:///topics/guards/">Guards</a>, received permission from the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to start a covert program to obtain nuclear weapons, so the <a href="file:///topics/guards/">Guards</a> contacted Pakistani generals and Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear scientist.</p>
<p>Commander Ali Shamkhani traveled to Pakistan, offering billions of 
dollars for a bomb, but ended up with a blueprint and centrifuges 
instead. The first centrifuge was transferred to <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> on Khomeini’s personal plane.</p>
<p>In a second but parallel attempt to amass nuclear weapons, <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> turned to the former Soviet republics. When the <a href="file:///topics/soviet-union/">Soviet Union</a> dissolved in 1990, <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> coveted thousands of tactical nuclear warheads that had been dispersed in the former republics.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the <a href="file:///topics/united-states-central-intelligence-agency/">CIA</a> asked me to find an Iranian scientist who would testify that <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> had the bomb. The <a href="file:///topics/united-states-central-intelligence-agency/">CIA</a> had learned that Iranian intelligence agents were visiting nuclear installations throughout the former <a href="file:///topics/soviet-union/">Soviet Union</a>, with particular interest in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, which had a significant portion of the Soviet arsenal and is predominately Muslim, was courted by Muslim <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>
 with offers of hundreds of millions of dollars for the bomb. Reports 
soon surfaced that three nuclear warheads were missing. This was 
corroborated by Russian Gen. Victor Samoilov, who handled the 
disarmament issues for the general staff. He admitted that the three 
were missing from Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Paul Muenstermann, then vice president of the German Federal Intelligence Service, said <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>
 had received two of the three nuclear warheads and medium-range nuclear
 delivery systems from Kazakhstan. It also was reported that <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> had purchased four 152 mm nuclear shells from the former <a href="file:///topics/soviet-union/">Soviet Union</a>, which were reportedly stolen and sold by former Red Army officers.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, several years later, Russian officials stated 
that when comparing documents in transferring nuclear weapons from 
Ukraine to Russia, there was a discrepancy of 250 nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Last week, Mathew Nasuti, a former U.S. Air Force captain who was at 
one point hired by the State Department as an adviser to one of its 
provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq, said that in March 2008, during
 a briefing on <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> at the State Department, the department’s Middle East expert told the group that it was “common knowledge” that <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> had acquired tactical nuclear weapons from one or more of the former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, an experienced intelligence officer and recipient of a Bronze Star, told me that his sources say <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> has two workable nuclear warheads.</p>
<p>An editorial in Kayhan, the Iranian newspaper directly under the 
supervision of the Office of the Supreme Leader, last year warned that 
if <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a> were attacked, there would be nuclear blasts in American cities.</p>
<p>Despite knowing that Iranian leaders were seeking nuclear weapons, 
Western leaders chose to negotiate and appease with the hope of reaching
 a solution with <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>.
 Nearly three years into President Obama’s administration, we must 
acknowledge that the policies of first a carrot of good will and then a 
stick of sanctions have neither stopped the Iranians with their nuclear 
program nor have they deterred their aggressive posture. The Iranian 
leaders today, despite four sets of United Nations sanctions, continue 
with their missile and nuclear enrichment program, and they have enough 
enriched uranium for six nuclear bombs, according to the latest 
International Atomic Energy Agency report.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary <a href="file:///topics/guards/">Guards</a> now have more than 1,000 ballistic missiles, many pointed at U.S. military bases in the Middle East and Europe. The <a href="file:///topics/guards/">Guards</a>
 also have made great strides in their intercontinental missile delivery
 system under the guise of their space program. As I revealed earlier, 
nuclear weapons-capable warheads have been delivered to the <a href="file:///topics/guards/">Guards</a>, and <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>’s supreme leader has ordered the <a href="file:///topics/guards/">Guards</a>
 to arm their missiles with nuclear payloads. Iran’s navy also has armed
 its vessels with long-range surface-to-surface missiles and soon will 
expand its mission into the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>“History suggests that we may already be too late to stop <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>’s nuclear bomb. Why do we suppose <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>
 cannot accomplish in 20 years of trying - with access to vast amounts 
of unclassified data on nuclear-weapons design and equipped with 
21st-century technology - what the U.S. accomplished in three years 
during the 1940s with the Manhattan Project?” asks nuclear weapons 
expert Peter Vincent Pry, who served in the <a href="file:///topics/united-states-central-intelligence-agency/">CIA</a> and on the EMP Commission, and is now president of EMPact America.</p>
<p>Mr. Pry concludes that <a href="file:///topics/islamic-republic-of-iran/">Iran</a>
 only needs a single nuclear weapon to destroy the United States. A 
nuclear EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack could collapse the national 
electric grid and other critical infrastructures that sustain the lives 
of 310 million Americans.</p>
<p>Are we ready to finally realize what the goals and the ideology of 
the jihadists in Tehran are and take appropriate action against them? 
The Iranian people themselves, who oppose the dictatorial mullahs, for 
years have asked us to do so. Thousands of them have lost their lives to
 show us the true nature of this regime. We must act before it’s too 
late.</p>
