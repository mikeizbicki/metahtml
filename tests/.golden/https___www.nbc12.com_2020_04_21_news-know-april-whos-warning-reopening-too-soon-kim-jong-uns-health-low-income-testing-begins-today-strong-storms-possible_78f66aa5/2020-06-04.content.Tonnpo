<h1>News to Know for April 21: WHO’s warning on reopening too soon; Kim 
Jong Un’s health; Low-income testing begins today; Strong storms 
possible</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> By <a href="file:///authors/nbc12-newsroom/"> <span>NBC12 Newsroom</span></a> <span>|</span> <span> April 21, 2020 at 6:49 AM EDT - Updated April 21 at 6:49 AM </span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - Here’s a quick look at our top headlines to help get you out the door.</p>
<h3> First Alert Weather Day For Strong Storms</h3>
<p>First Alert Weather Day Tuesday for a few severe storms possible mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>First Alert Weather Day for Tuesday afternoon with marginal severe 
storm risk for a few isolated storms with strong gusts and hail 
possible. </p>
<p>Warm and breezy with a few strong storms possible</p>
<p>Widespread storms are not expected and risk will be isolated and mainly eastern Virginia</p>
<p>Best time for central Virginia 2 p.m.-4 p.m.</p>
<h3> Steakhouse Fire </h3>
<p>Brian’s Steakhouse located in Mecklenburg County <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/21/brians-steakhouse-mecklenburg-county-catches-fire/">caught on fire Tuesday morning</a>.</p>
<p>Fire crews responded to Brian’s Steakhouse located at 625 East Atlantic Street for the report of a structure fire.</p>
<p>Upon arriving, crews noticed heavy fire coming through the roof.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
<h3> Kim Jong Un</h3>
<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appeared to be handling state affairs, as usual, South Korea’s government said Tuesday after <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/20/us-source-north-korean-leader-grave-danger-after-surgery/">unconfirmed rumors described him as in fragile condition after surgery</a>.</p>
<p>The presidential Blue House said no unusual activity has been 
detected in North Korea and it had no information about the rumors on 
Kim’s health. </p>
<p>Speculation often surfaces about North Korea’s leadership based on attendance at important state events. </p>
<p>Kim, who is in his mid-30s, missed the celebration of his late 
grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, the country’s 
most important holiday.</p>
<h3> Coronavirus Updates</h3>
<p>As the coronavirus continues to dominate headlines, <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/health/coronavirus/">NBC12 put everything you need to know in one place</a> to make it easier to stay up to date.</p>
<h3> WHO’s Warning</h3>
<p>The World Health Organization said Tuesday that <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/21/who-warns-rush-ease-coronavirus-rules-could-cause-resurgence/">rushing to ease coronavirus restrictions will likely lead to a resurgence of the illness</a>, a warning that comes as governments start rolling out plans to get their economies up and running again.</p>
<p>Despite concerns from health officials, some U.S. states on Monday 
announced aggressive reopening plans, while Boeing and at least one 
other U.S. heavy-equipment manufacturer resumed production. </p>
<p>Elsewhere around the world, step-by-step reopenings were underway in 
Europe, where the crisis has begun to ebb in places such as Italy, Spain
 and Germany.</p>
<p>The reopenings come as politicians grow weary of soaring unemployment numbers and the prospect of economic depression. </p>
<h3> COVID-19 In Virginia</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/18/coronavirus-deaths-surpass-virginia-here-are-latest-numbers-state/">Virginia Department of Health (VDH) reported 8,537 confirmed COVID-19 cases</a>, 277 deaths and 1,422 hospitalizations throughout the state Sunday.</p>
<p>So far, 54,733 Virginians have now been tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Central VA Case Highlights:</p>
<ul> <li>Henrico: 584</li> <li>Chesterfield: 311</li> <li>Richmond: 231</li> <li>Hanover: 84</li> <li>Goochland: 55</li> <li>Petersburg: 21</li> </ul>
<p>The numbers reported by the Virginia Health Department are only updated once a day.</p>
<h3> Low-Income Testing Begins Today</h3>
<p>The Richmond and Henrico Health Districts will be <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/20/richmond-henrico-health-districts-offering-free-covid-testing-community-locations/">offering free COVID-19 testing this week to residents</a> in the Woodman West and Henrico Arms neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Health officials said if you live near these neighborhoods and are 
experiencing symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough or a fever, 
call the Health District hotline at 804-205-3501 for more information.</p>
<p>Other free COVID-19 testing is being offered to those who may not have insurance or whose insurance does not cover COVID-19.</p>
<p>The purpose of the testing is to provide access to testing in vulnerable communities where residents may not have access.</p>
<p>Locations are not being disclosed to enable an orderly and efficient testing operation.</p>
<h3> Gov. Northam Increasing State Testing</h3>
<p>Virginia’s former health commissioner will lead a <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/20/governor-northam-creates-work-group-increase-state-testing-capability/">new workgroup focusing specifically on COVID-19 testing in the state</a>.</p>
<p>Governor Ralph Northam made the announcement Monday during a 
coronavirus briefing in Richmond. Northam said as of Monday, the state 
does not have the testing materials to even consider phase one of 
lifting restrictions.</p>
<p>But the state is slowly increasing testing capabilities. Northam said
 that’s in part thanks to private and university labs stepping up. The 
state lab will also increase testing capacity per day thanks to new 
equipment from Altria. Northam said the key to lifting restrictions is 
to make sure the state has the testing capacity.</p>
<p>The state is expected to see its virus peak later this week.</p>
<h3> Earth Week In RVA</h3>
<p>Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney has <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/20/mayor-stoney-declares-it-earth-week-richmond/">declared April 20-24 Earth Week in Richmond</a>.</p>
<p>Earth Day falls on April 22 and it will be the 50th year for its celebration.</p>
<p>Stoney will be hosting a Facebook Live on Wednesday at noon, along 
with RVA Green 2050, which is a state-of-the-art equity-centered, 
climate action and resilience planning process to accelerate efforts on 
community-wide decarbonization and resilience.</p>
<p>The Facebook discussion will center around equity, resilience and 
sustainability in the face of crises like COVID-19 and climate change.</p>
