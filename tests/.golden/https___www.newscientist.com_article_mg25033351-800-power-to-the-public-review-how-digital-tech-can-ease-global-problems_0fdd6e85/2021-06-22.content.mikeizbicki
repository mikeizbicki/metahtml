<p class="rm-manual">Tara Dawson McGuinness and Hana Schank</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Princeton University Press</p>
<h5 class="rm-manual">Advertisement</h5>
<p>THE question of how best to use technology to meet the everyday needs
 of citizens is on the agenda, especially in the US, where President Joe
 Biden wants to “listen to science”. So far, he has embedded data 
experts and technologists in all his teams.</p>
<p>But there is a mountain to climb. “There is no solving the world’s 
hardest problems without governments and institutions that really work 
for people,” warn Tara Dawson McGuinness and Hana Schank in Power to the
 Public. Leaders have no prerogative to fail, the authors say.</p>
<p>This is a high bar: governments can and do fail their citizens. But 
the tricky question “why” hovers over the book. McGuinness and Schank 
have good credentials, though: both work for Washington DC-based think 
tank <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/">New America</a>, and McGuinness was on the Biden transition team.</p>
<p>Written during the coronavirus pandemic, the book catalogues both 
recent and historical failures and successes in public policy. For 
example, many governments failed to offer key services in the pandemic, 
from reliable test-and-trace systems and vaccination scheduling to 
financial support to businesses during lockdowns.</p>
<p>Looking further back, the authors cite awful examples where public 
systems were designed without listening to, well, anyone much. One such 
was exposed in 2011 when the UK abandoned its bid to create the world’s 
largest civilian computer system, linking National Health Service 
records in England. Nine years in the making and costing over £11 
billion, it is seen as one of the most expensive fiascos in public 
sector history.</p>
<p>In the US, former President Barack Obama may have tweeted praise for 
the book, but his Affordable Care Act, which widened health insurance 
coverage, gets a bashing in it. In 2013, its website crashed 2 hours 
after launch. By the end of the day, only six people had managed to 
select a health insurance plan.</p>
<p>“Crisis Text Line knows the exact time people are most vulnerable and the emojis they use at their lowest point”</p>
<p>The authors also argue for a formula they think could improve things:
 “design informed by real human needs, the use of real-time data to 
guide problem solving, and a focus on delivery in order to continuously 
learn and improve”. These ideas come from the private sector. “If 
Starbucks can use data to better understand when their customers want a 
Frappuccino, think of the endless possibilities for governments and 
non-profits to use these… tools.”</p>
<p>While this is a naive analogy – after all, the wrong public policy 
can be measured in lives, not coffee – the authors are passionate about 
what they and others call public interest technology. Some of this harks
 back to the 1980s, when social theorists asked if tech would be better 
designed around people’s real needs, and used for civic not surveillance
 purposes. Fast forward, add big data, social media, artificial 
intelligence and real-time systems – and look at what public interest 
tech can do.</p>
<p>Here, the authors’ success stories are even more interesting. Take 
Crisis Text Line, a mental health organisation founded in 2013 to reach 
young people in crisis in the US using text messages. It offers a 
24-hour service, putting texters in touch with trained counsellors. It 
now also operates in the UK, Canada and Ireland. In 2020, it supported 
about 844,000 texters.</p>
<p>While Crisis Text Line collects real-time data, the US’s largest 
collection of mental health data (run by the Centers for Disease Control
 and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health) comes from 
mental health surveys, with results out a year later. Crisis Text Line, 
however, knows the exact time people are most vulnerable and what emojis
 teenagers use at their lowest point.</p>
<p>But before world leaders can use these new tools, they must address 
something omitted from the book: the millions with no access to the 
simplest tech, often in low-income countries, but sometimes not far from
 the White House.</p>
