<h> How to register for a COVID-19 vaccine in Hua Hin

<p> In response to a number of emails and messages from readers confused about how they can register for a COVID-19 vaccine, Hua Hin Today has been in contact with local health officials in order to clarify the situation for people living in Hua Hin.

<h> Who can register for a COVID-19 vaccine?

<p> Currently anyone over the age of 18 can register to receive the vaccine.

<p> However, priority is being given to the over 60s and sufferers of one of seven chronic health conditions.

<p> We have received reports of people aged under 60 being able to register, while others have said they were told they could only register after June 6.

<p> If you are over 60 you are urged to register for the vaccine as soon as possible. It is likely you will be given an appointment date in early July.

<p> Hua Hin Today has spoken to several expats aged over 60 who have already been given appointment dates in the first week of July, all of whom were given appointments within 48 hours of registering.

<h> Where to register for a COVID-19 vaccine?

<p> There are registration desks set up at both Market Village and BluPort shopping malls.

<p> At Market Village, the registration desks are located in the middle of the ground floor between the Bata shoe shop on one side and Boots pharmacy on the other.

<p> The desks are open from 11am to 6pm, with dedicated English speakers available between 11am and 4pm.

<p> At BluPort, the registration desks are located opposite the Coffee Club on the ground floor.

<p> You can also register at Hua Hin Hospital but it is perhaps more convenient (and a bit quieter) to complete the registration at Market Village or BluPort.

<p> There is a registration desk near the main entrance to AE at Hua Hin hospital, which is open from 9am  to 5pm.

<h> How to register?

<p> To register, you will need to complete the registration form below. Take along your passport, and a photocopy of the ID page. Make sure you write clearly.

<p> Once you have registered, you will be contacted to confirm your vaccination appointment date.

<h> Where to get vaccinated?

<p> This will be confirmed to you once you receive your appointment date but it will likely be at Hua Hin Hospital.

<p> It was originally announced that vaccination centres would be set up at seven different locations in Hua Hin and while Hua Hin Today understands these may still be set up in the future, the first phase of vaccinations will take place on the 10th floor of Hua Hin Hospital.
