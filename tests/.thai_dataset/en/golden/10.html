<h> Outbreak in Thailand will delay recovery in tourism, affecting more than 7 million people

<p> Mr. Danucha said the outbreak will delay a recovery in tourism, affecting more than 7 million of the sector’s workers.

<p> The National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) has reported that Thailands unemployment rate hit a 12-year high in the first quarter of 2021, due to the impact of the latest COVID-19 outbreaks.

<p> NESDC secretary-general Danucha Pichayanan said the unemployment rate was 1.96% in the January-March quarter, or 758,000 people without jobs, up from 1.86% in the previous quarter. The rate was the highest since 2.08% recorded in the first quarter of 2009 during the global financial crisis.

<p> He said the unemployment rate has increased dramatically and is expected to rise again, reflecting the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The prolonged COVID-19 outbreak may prevent the economy from growing as targeted, as economic activity has slowed again.

<p> Mr. Danucha said the outbreak will delay a recovery in tourism, affecting more than 7 million of the sector’s workers. However, the number of employed workers reached 37.6 million in the first quarter, up 0.4% from a year ago, due to higher employment in the agricultural sector, which has absorbed some of the workers laid off in other sectors since 2020.
