<h> Monks in Pattaya believe the number of decreased Covid19 infections in this coastal town is a result of their group prayer earlier this month

<p> Earlier this month, more than a hundred Buddhist monks gathered in a prayer ceremony at the Wat Chai in South Pattaya, one activity that received permission from relevant officials to proceed and took place under numerous Covid-19 precautions.

<p> The grand prayer ceremony was designed to pray away the Covid-19 virus in the area and motivate believers.

<p> According to Phra Panya Rattanaporn, who led the prayer activity, the ritual had brought happiness and karma to the city and province of Chonburi, which has recently seen a significant reduction in the number of Covid-19 cases and was recently lowered from its highest level from Covid-19 restrictions to a lower level, allowing dining to fully open at local restaurants and returning many people to work.

<p> However, Chonburi Public Health officials have stated that the decrease in the number of cases is attributed to the fact that residents of the province remain socially at a distance, work from home when possible, and as a whole cooperate in restrictions and measures such as avoiding crowds. and social gatherings. This is accompanied by an average of several thousand Covid19 tests per day, usually targeting high-risk locations and places such as business parks and people who work with the public, such as those at supermarkets or taxi drivers.

<p> Meanwhile, Pattaya police have attributed the reduction to strict surveillance and stopping of parties, hanging out on local beaches, and forcing the closure of entertainment venues and similar establishments where people normally gather and socialize. Pattaya City Police have been strict in enforcing meetings of only two people regarding drinking alcohol in public or organizing small parties on local beaches, with multiple reports of arrests in recent weeks and nearly daily reminders from law enforcement that this is not the time to have social gatherings.

<p> Pattaya plans to launch its own massive vaccination program later this week, with the ambitious goal of having 70% of local residents fully vaccinated within a few months in preparation for a planned reopening to vaccinated foreign tourists in October.
