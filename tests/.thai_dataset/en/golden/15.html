<h> Bangkok Island Hidden Gem  Koh Kret

<p> Ko Kret is a small island in the Chao Phraya River, just north of Bangkok, Thailand. It’s known as a settlement of the Mon people, whose famed terracotta is on display in the Kwan Aman Museum. This traditional earthenware is still produced in potteries along the river. On the northeastern tip of the island, Wat Poramai Yikawat is an important Buddhist temple featuring a reclining Buddha and a leaning stupa.

<p> The island dates back to 1722, when a canal was constructed as a shortcut to bypass a bend in the Om Kret branch of the Chao Phraya river. As the canal was widened over the years, the section cut off eventually became a separate island. The island continues to serve as a refuge to the Mon tribes who dominated central Thailand between the 6th and 10th centuries and have retained a distinct identity in their version of Buddhism and, particularly at Ko Kret, their pottery.

<p> Here you can enjoy Craft Beer right on the river bank at Chitbeer (try pronouncing that 😉 view the local pottery and even pick up a piece or two for as low as 5bhat ($0.17). Rent a bicycle and take the short trip around the island, see how the locals live and visit the many Wats.
