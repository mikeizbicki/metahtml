Let yourselves be heard.</span></p> <p class="date-outer"><ins></ins></p><h2 class="date-header"><ins><span>Monday, April 22, 2019</span></ins></h2><ins> </ins><p class="post hentry uncustomized-post-template"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="post-title entry-title"><ins><a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/2014/04/earth-day-44-years-later-and-we-are-all.html">Earth Day 2019 Link: http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/2014/04/earth-day-44-years-later-and-we-are-all.html </a> </ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>Earth Day 48 years later and we are all the worse despite it!</ins></p><p><ins>We celebrate earth hour, earth day, earth week every year and every year
 we get much worse. Last year was pretty bad! Besides the normal 
suspects of our pollution problem which will follow I want to remind you
 of this: Global nuclear cover-up, Depleted uranium, Gulf war 
Syndrome,increased Autism Diabetes Cancer, they won't admit it but Now 
you know why! Leuren Moret is a whistle blower from the Livermore Lab. 
In her presentations she exposes shocking and highly suppressed facts 
about our Government poisoning is with radiation right at this very 
moment.</ins></p><p><ins>Leuren documents every statement she makes with research documents many 
of which are actual Government Data to draw their conclusions. Did you 
know that diabetes, Autism, and other forms of mental illness are caused
 by exposure on nuclear radiation. No wonder Diabetes and Autism are on 
the upswing and supposedly no one knows why. You have to believe they do
 not want you to know the truth here too. <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3626298989248030643&amp;q=nuclear+radiation:#">watch the video of Lauren speaking the truth about the nuclear coverup Link: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3626298989248030643&amp;q=nuclear+radiation:# </a></ins></p><p><ins>From nuclear testing we have switched to nuclear power plants that are 
causing increasingly high rates of cancer, birth defects, and literally 
an epidemic of diabetes. I have heard it mentioned here before that we 
have used weapons containing depleted Uranium and didn't really think 
too much about it because I really wasn't sure.</ins></p><p><ins>However watching this video totally documented that depleted uranium has
 not only turned Iraq and Afghanistan into uninhabitable nuclear 
holocaust for millions of years. Remember the Gulf war Syndrome? 
Depleted uranium was also used at Tora Bora. I was not aware of that! 
Cancer among soldiers is rampant!</ins></p><p><ins>We are giving our soldiers a death sentence. Why are we not testing our 
soldiers? You know why! Anyway it is also blowing over the rest of the 
planet causing Americans, Europeans, and others to die from radiation 
diseases. <a href="http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/video?p=global+nuclear+cover+up">Global nuclear cover up Link: http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/video?p=global+nuclear+cover+up </a></ins></p><p><ins>Now the standard problems: <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/health/article267462.ece">880 mn people lack access to clean water: Red Cross Link: http://www.thehindu.com/health/article267462.ece </a></ins></p><p><ins>After happening onto Fabien Cousteau discussing the fact that it has now

 43,000 tons of food away every day in America. That is sick in itself!

much of our chemicals we use to grow our food ends up in the ocean along
 with all our other debris. As a result the monstrous garbage swirl in 
the pacific described above is only one. There are many and they are in 
every ocean. The debris field in the pacific is 90 feet deep. We have to
 do something. We are drowning in our Garbage. It is taking over the 
world. The world as we knew it is already gone. The world as we know it 
is right behind unless we wake up and yesterday not next year!</ins></p><p><ins>James Joiner</ins></p><p><ins>Gardner, Ma</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com Link: http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/ </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

Phenomenal!</ins></p><p><ins>The celebration in Boston has traditionally been televised so the entire world can enjoy what Bostonian s get to experience. This year it is not going to be televised world wide I heard so I thought you might enjoy a few excerpts from past celebrations. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Also, a couple treats: After nearly three years of excavation, archaeologists confirmed 
the discovery of the site of George Washington's boyhood home near the 
banks of the Rappahannock River in northeast Virginia a few years ago. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/07/03/washington.boyhood.home/index.html">Archaeologists found remains of Washington's boyhood home Link: http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/07/03/washington.boyhood.home/index.html </a></ins></p><p><ins>Then to celebrate it A rare and original manuscript of one of America's 
most patriotic songs has been discovered in a flea market bargain. A 
shopper browsing through the market in New York bought a framed picture 
of a flower for $10 and found handwritten manuscript of "America" (My 
Country 'tis of Thee) tucked behind the picture, the manuscript's owner 
said Thursday.</ins></p><p><ins>The manuscript of the song whose lyrics were written by Samuel Francis 
Smith in 1831 could be worth tens of thousands of dollars, said the 
owner, art collector Keya Morgan. He said he bought it from the flea 
market shopper, who has asked not to be identified. The song was 
intended to be played in schools to inspire and teach children and was 
first played in public on July 4, 1831, in the First Baptist Church in 
Newton, Massachusetts, Morgan said. The song is written to the tune of 
"God Save the Queen," the national anthem of the United Kingdom. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/07/03/flea.market/index.html">Rare song manuscript found in flea market Link: http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/07/03/flea.market/index.html </a></ins></p><p><ins>It is primarily a scorcher today in Western 
Massachusetts but I will try to cook on the grill in celebration of the 
day. I hope you all can do the same. Have a nice Fourth of July and God 
Bless America!</ins></p><p><ins>James Joiner</ins></p><p><ins>Gardner Ma</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com%20/">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com

Charles Plumb was a US Navy jet pilot in Vietnam. After 75 combat  missions, his plane was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile. Plumb  ejected and parachuted into enemy hands.</ins></p><p><ins>He was captured and spent 6  years in a communist Vietnamese prison. He survived the ordeal and now  lectures on lessons learned from that experience!   One day, when Plumb and his wife were sitting in a restaurant, a man at  another table came up and said, "You're Plumb! You flew jet fighters in  Vietnam from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. You were shot down!"</ins></p><p><ins>"How in the world did you know that?" asked Plumb.   "I packed your parachute," the man replied. Plumb gasped in surprise  and gratitude. The man pumped his hand and said, "I guess it worked !"  Plumb assured him, "It sure did. If your chute hadn't worked, I wouldn't  be here today."</ins></p><p><ins>Plumb couldn't sleep that night, thinking about that man. Plumb says,  "! I kept wondering what he had looked like in a Navy uniform: a white  hat; a bib in the back; and bell-bottom trousers. I wonder how many times  I might have seen him and not even said 'Good morning, how are you?' or  anything because, you see, I was a fighter pilot and he was just a  sailor."</ins></p><p><ins>Plumb thought of the many hours the sailor had spent at a long  wooden table in the bowels of the ship, carefully weaving the shrouds and  folding the silks of each chute, holding in his hands each time the fate  of someone he didn't know.</ins></p><p><ins>Now, Plumb asks his audience, "Who's packing your parachute? "Everyone  has someone who provides what they need to make it through the day. He  also points out that he needed many kinds of parachutes when his plane  was shot down over enemy territory, he needed his physical parachute,  his mental parachute, his emotional parachute, and his spiritual  parachute. He called on all these supports before reaching safety.</ins></p><p><ins>Sometimes in the daily challenges that life gives us, we miss what is  really important. We may fail to say hello, please, or thank you,  congratulate   someone on something wonderful that has happened to them, give a  compliment, or just do something nice for no reason. As you go through this week, this month, this year, recognize people who pack your parachutes.  This is my way of thanking you for your part in packing my parachute.</ins></p><p><ins>James Joiner</ins></p><p><ins>Gardner, Ma</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://www.anaveragepatriot.com/">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com Link: http://www.anaveragepatriot.com/ </a></ins></p><p><ins><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags:<a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Charles+Plumb" rel="tag" target="_blank" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for Charles Plumb">Charles Plumb Link: http://www.technorati.com/tag/Charles+Plumb </a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Kitty+Hawk" rel="tag" target="_blank" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for Kitty Hawk">Kitty Hawk Link: http://www.technorati.com/tag/Kitty+Hawk </a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Vietnam" rel="tag" target="_blank" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for Vietnam">Vietnam Link: http://www.technorati.com/tag/Vietnam </a></span></ins></p><p><ins><span class="sociallinks">Add to: | <a href="http://technorati.com/faves?add=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml" target="_blank">Technorati Link: http://technorati.com/faves?add=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml </a> |  <a href="http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml" target="_blank">Digg Link: http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml </a> |  <a href="http://del.icio.us/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml;title=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F" target="_blank">del.icio.us Link: http://del.icio.us/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml;title=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F </a> |  <a href="http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/myresults/bookmarklet?t=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml" target="_blank">Yahoo Link: http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/myresults/bookmarklet?t=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml </a> |  <a href="http://www.blinklist.com/index.php?Action=Blink/addblink.php&amp;Url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml&amp;Title=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F" target="_blank">BlinkList Link: http://www.blinklist.com/index.php?Action=Blink/addblink.php&amp;Url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml&amp;Title=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F </a> |  <a href="http://www.spurl.net/spurl.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml&amp;title=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F" target="_blank">Spurl Link: http://www.spurl.net/spurl.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml&amp;title=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F </a> |  <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml&amp;title=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F" target="_blank">reddit Link: http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml&amp;title=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F </a> |   <a href="http://www.furl.net/storeIt.jsp?t=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml" target="_blank">Furl Link: http://www.furl.net/storeIt.jsp?t=%20Who%27s%20Packing%20Your%20Parachute%3F&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fanaverageamericanpatriot%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F04%2Fwhos%2Dpacking%2Dyour%2Dparachute%2Ehtml </a> |  </span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

commemorates U.S. men and women who perished while in military service to their 
country. First enacted to honor Union soldiers of the American Civil 
War</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>Traditional observance</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>Many people observe this holiday by 
visiting cemeteries and memorials. A national moment of remembrance takes place 
at 3 p.m. US Eastern time. Another tradition is to fly the U.S. flag at 
half-staff from dawn until noon local time. Volunteers usually place an American 
flag upon each grave site located in a National Cemetery.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>In addition to 
remembrance, Memorial Day is also used as a time for picnics, barbecues, family 
gatherings, and sporting events. One of the longest standing traditions is the 
running of the Indianapolis 500, which has been held in conjunction with 
Memorial Day since 1911. Some Americans also view Memorial Day as the unofficial 
beginning of summer and Labor Day as the unofficial end of the season. The 
national "Click It or Ticket" campaign ramps up beginning Memorial Day weekend, 
noting the beginning of the most dangerous season for auto accidents and other 
safety related incidents. The U.S. Air Force "101 Critical Days of Summer" begin 
on this day as well. Many Americans use Memorial Day to also honor any family 
members who have died, not just servicemen.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>Memorial Day formerly 
occurred on May 30, and some, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and 
Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW), advocate returning to this 
fixed date, although the significance of the date is tenuous. The VFW stated in 
a 2002 Memorial Day Address, "Changing the date merely to create three-day 
weekends has undermined the very meaning of the day. No doubt, this has 
contributed a lot to the general public's nonchalant observance of Memorial 
Day." Hawaii's Senator Daniel Inouye, a World War II veteran, has repeatedly 
introduced measures to return Memorial Day to its traditional day since 
1987.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>Community Observance</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>In addition to national observances, many 
individual communities hold memorial observance for fallen soldiers who were 
from that town by having a ceremony in a church or town memorial park. It is 
also common for fire and police departments to remember and honor members lost 
in the line of duty. Towns often hold a memorial day parade to remember those 
people. Participation in such a parade is by community organizations such as 
members of the local emergency services and their vehicles, Rotary Clubs, Boy 
Scouts, Girl Scouts, and bands from the local high school or church groups. 
Communities may also hold a town-wide picnic barbecue at a local park in which 
the whole town is invited to attend.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>History</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>Following the end of the 
Civil War, many communities set aside a day to mark the end of the war or as a 
memorial to those who had died. Some of the places creating an early memorial 
day include Charleston, South Carolina; Boalsburg, Pennsylvania; Richmond, 
Virginia; Carbondale, Illinois; Columbus, Mississippi; many communities in 
Vermont; and some two dozen other cities and towns. These observances eventually 
coalesced around Decoration Day, honoring the Union dead, and the several 
Confederate Memorial Days.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>According to Professor David Blight of the 
Yale University History Department, the first memorial day was observed in 1865 
by liberated slaves at the historic race track in Charleston. The site was a 
former Confederate prison camp as well as a mass grave for Union soldiers who 
had died while captive. The freed slaves reinterred the dead Union soldiers from 
the mass grave to individual graves, fenced in the graveyard &amp; built an 
entry arch declaring it a Union graveyard; a very daring thing to do in the 
South shortly after North's victory. On May 30 1886? the freed slaves returned 
to the spiffed up graveyard with flowers they'd picked from the countryside 
&amp; decorated the individual grave-sites, thereby creating the 1st Decoration 
Day. A parade with thousands of freed blacks and Union soldiers was followed by 
patriotic singing and a picnic.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>The official birthplace of Memorial Day 
is Waterloo, New York. The village was credited with being the birthplace 
because it observed the day on May 5, 1866, and each year thereafter, and 
because it is likely that the friendship of General John Murray, a distinguished 
citizen of Waterloo, and General John A. Logan, who led the call for the day to 
be observed each year and helped spread the event nationwide, was a key factor 
in its growth.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>General Logan had been impressed by the way the South 
honored their dead with a special day and decided the Union needed a similar 
day. Reportedly, Logan said that it was most fitting; that the ancients, 
especially the Greeks, had honored their dead, particularly their heroes, by 
chaplets of laurel and flowers, and that he intended to issue an order 
designating a day for decorating the grave of every soldier in the land, and if 
he could he would have made it a holiday.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>Logan had been the principal 
speaker in a citywide memorial observation on April 29, 1866 at a cemetery in 
Carbondale, Illinois, an event that likely gave him the idea to make it a 
national holiday. On May 5, 1868 in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the 
Grand Army of the Republic, a veterans' organization, Logan issued a 
proclamation that "Decoration Day" be observed nationwide. It was observed for 
the first time on May 30 of the same year; the date was chosen because it was 
not the anniversary of a battle. The tombs of fallen Union soldiers were 
decorated in remembrance of this day.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>Many of the states of the U.S. 
South refused to celebrate Decoration Day, due to lingering hostility towards 
the Union Army and also because there were very few veterans of the Union Army 
who lived in the South. A notable exception was Columbus, Mississippi, which on 
April 25, 1866 at its Decoration Day commemorated both the Union and Confederate 
casualties buried in its cemetery.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>The alternative name of "Memorial Day" 
was first used in 1882 but did not become more common until after World War II 
and was not declared the official name by Federal law until 1967 . On June 28, 
1968 the United States Congress passed the Uniform Holidays Bill which moved 
three holidays from their traditional dates to a specified Monday in order to 
create a convenient three-day weekend and for the first time recognized Columbus 
Day as a federal holiday.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>The holidays included Washington's Birthday 
(which evolved into Presidents' Day), Veterans Day and Memorial Day. The change 
moved Memorial Day from its traditional May 30 date to the last Monday in May. 
The law took effect at the federal level in 1971 . After some initial confusion 
and unwillingness to comply at the state level, all fifty states adopted the 
measure within a few years, although Veterans Day was eventually changed back to 
its traditional date. Ironically, most corporate businesses no longer close on 
Columbus Day or Veterans Day, and an increasing number are staying open on 
President's Day as well. Memorial Day, however, has endured as one holiday 
during which most businesses stay closed because it marks the beginning of the 
"summer vacation season," as does neighboring Canada's Victoria Day which occurs 
on the prior Monday.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>In literature and music</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>The southeastern U.S. 
celebrates Decoration Day as a day to decorate the graves of all family members, 
and it is not reserved for those who served in the military. The region observes 
Decoration Day the Sunday before Memorial Day. Jason Isbell of the rock band 
Drive-By Truckers chronicled such an event in his epic ballad "Decoration Day," 
which is also the title cut to the eponymous album.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>Charles Ives's 
symphonic poem "Decoration Day" depicts the holiday as he experienced it in his 
childhood, with his father's band leading the way to the town cemetery, the 
playing of Taps on a trumpet, and a livelier march tune on the way back to the 
town. It is frequently played with three other Ives works based on holidays as 
the second movement of A New England Holidays Symphony. Memorial Day USA</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins></ins></p><p class="post-body entry-content"><ins><span><span>I am

It was too late in 2007 when Greenspan's gift to Bush first started rearing it's ugly head. The collapse of the middle and lower classes along with the need was no coincidence nor was the timing setting it up to come to fruition on Obama's watch! There is apocalyptic pain coming and way you look at it so I pose a question I asked before. </ins></p><p><ins>What happens to the world if and when the U S files for Bankruptcy? </ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2435546/posts">America's Impending Master Class Dictatorship Link: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2435546/posts </a> Frightening but you can not deny this reality! We are in serious trouble and as I have pointed out for years it was done on purpose and right under our unsuspecting noses! Our real debt including Debt and unfunded liabilities is $120 trillion! Wrap your mind around that!</ins></p><p><ins>Those who have followed me over the years know I have often talked about the lie we are living today! I just Googled an example! <a href="https://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/2008/08/anthrax-attack-was-another-lie.html">An Average American Patriot: So many lies today in the lie we are ... Link: https://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/2008/08/anthrax-attack-was-another-lie.html </a></ins></p><p><ins>Think about it! What is the world without America? What would happen to the entire world if we were to file for Bankruptcy? China for one would be in anarchy and go under as the country she is today and wants to be tomorrow. I find this all very disturbing because it is laid on Obama's shoulders and being credited with this mess. Unfunded liabilities, ballooning deficit, ballooning debt, it is all Chinese to most of us. One thing I do know is President Clinton ran a surplus inherited by G W Bush. He was even looking at retiring the Debt. Bush changed all that forever!</ins></p><p><ins>Bush Cheney Greenspan Rove Gonzales, all the enablers, do not get enough credit for what they did in allowing the moral and financial bankrupting of America. I won't bother you with another link but Michael Whitney did a great piece detailing how Greenspan set it up. Those so called men are heralded as heroes by some. You have to realize they are all benefactors of this disaster.</ins></p><p><ins>I always said Bush or those behind him learned their lessons well and anything they touched would be much worse than a like event in History. During the Depression when Roosevelt was trying to rebuild America we knew it happened on the Republican's watch and who to blame. They also knew and wanted to help fix it not make it worse as Republicans are doing today.</ins></p><p><ins>Anyway think back and you will see that everything was done on purpose and especially the timing was no coincidence. Bush and Greenspan kept the collapse off until he was out of office. People say get over it! Move on! However we will never get over it or be able to forget Bush as much as we want as his damage will affect our and the worlds lives forever. No I am not giving that bunch too much credit.</ins></p><p><ins>They shaped our future and the future of the whole world like it or not! Get over it, not hardly! The debt clock had to be started during Reagan's time because of his success but could only register 9 trillion. Because of Bush's so called success it had to be altered to register 10 trillion, now we are almost $14 trillion. Now the debt is moving so fast it is going virile. 3.8 trillion is our new record budget for one year. How far off can bankruptcy be especially knowing how bad it really is? <a href="http://www.bankrupt-law.com/bankruptcy-faq-index.htm">Bankruptcy Questions &amp; Answers Link: http://www.bankrupt-law.com/bankruptcy-faq-index.htm </a></ins></p><p><ins>James m Joiner</ins></p><p><ins>Gardner, Ma</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com%20/">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com  Link: http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com%20/ </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by
