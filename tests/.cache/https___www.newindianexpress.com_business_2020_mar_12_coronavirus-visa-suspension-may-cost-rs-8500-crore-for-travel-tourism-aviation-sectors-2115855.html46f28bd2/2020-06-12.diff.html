The value at risk from this segment will be in multiples of tens of thousands of crores." With India cancelling all visas, the chamber said the impact "will be worse".</p><p>ANAROCK Property Consultants Chairman Anuj Puri said,"The cancellation of visas for foreigners as well as the strong advice issued to Indians to refrain from unnecessary travel will have a marked effect.</p><p>This is the most unsettling healthcare crisis in recent times and hotel bookings will go south.</p><p>" On Indians being advised to refrain from unnecessary travel, the CII report said,"The December holiday season of 2019 took an estimated hit of almost 40-50 per cent, the holiday season of April to July 2020 is likely to take a humongous hit which could be as high as 80-100 per cent, unless there is positive news of the progression of virus decreasing.</p><p>VFS Global Regional Group COO - South Asia, Middle East and North Africa, Americas Vinay Malhotra said,"While it is too early to comment on the impact of coronavirus on visa application trends, so far, our visa application processes in India continue on schedule as per the mandates of our client governments." MakeMyTrip Group CEO Rajesh Magow said,"The decision by the government will have an impact on inbound and outbound international travel."</p> <p class="morefrom"><ins><span>Stay up to date on all the latest <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/business">Business Link: https://www.newindianexpress.com/business </a> news with The New Indian Express App. <a target="_BLANK" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newindianexpress.news">Download now Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newindianexpress.news </a></span></ins></p> </article>
