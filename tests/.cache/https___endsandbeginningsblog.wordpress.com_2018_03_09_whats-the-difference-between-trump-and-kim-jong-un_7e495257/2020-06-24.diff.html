Eight inches. Trump claims to have grown an inch so his official height is now 6’3″. Kim Jong Un says he is 5’7″. Of course that is wearing platform shoes and includes three inches of hair. There isn’t a sandbox big enough to contain these two egos, and that is what we should all be worried about.</p> <p>Trump hasn’t given the American people any indication that he is a grown-up and if he doesn’t take any grown-ups with him to North Korea we should all be scared shitless. This isn’t like stiffing the Sheetrock contractor or telling the bank to sue me when he defaults on a loan, millions of lives are at stake and we have already seen that Trump has no regard for humanity.</p> <p>Here is the issue that I have with this deal, Trumps motives. This smells like, at least to me, that he is attempting to change the story currently playing out in the media taking the attention off of Stormy Daniels and putting it back on him. That is what egotistical narcissists do and we all know he is the poster child for an egotistical narcissist.</p> <p>If his motives were pure, if his attentions were true the people in his administration that have a stake in these negotiations would have known about what was coming down the pipe in advance. They didn’t, at least all indications are that they didn’t.</p> <p>I am all for having a dialog with Kim Jong Un. I just wish we had someone smarter, more mature representing our interest. This could turn-out to be a Stormy situation for all of us.</p> <p>“A weakened, amateur president agrees to highest-level diplomatic talks with a rogue nuclear power, without a clear strategy or diplomatic team in place.

A local radio talk host in Baltimore, back in the Clinton era, if I recall correctly what he did, labeled every single foreign adventure or military action (e.g. the bombing of Bosnia) as an attempt to deflect from the then-current sex scandal.  The issue became for me:  there was NEVER, NEVER AT ANY MOMENT, NOT a then-current sex scandal.  That’s just the way it was.

The North Koreans have done this trick many times before.  They are practiced at it.  They start off with claiming they have been insulted and need to be dragged back to the table with promises.  Then they get as much as they can out of the deal.  They take while back tracking on anything they claimed to give up.  Once they get caught they laugh that they got over on the other partie.  Sort of like tRump has tried to clusmly done with contractors and banks.  The difference as you say is the stakes and the results achieved.   tRump barely gets out of it with a paltry sum, the Koreans have shown they can get a great deal doing it.   Plus they bring practiced skilled negotiators to the table.  Trained ones.  We have tRump and his ego in charge of our side.  Who will he take with him, Wilbur Ross?   The Koreans will eat them for lunch and stick them with the tab.   Plus the gain is already on their side.  The one thing denied them was a face to face visit with the president of the USA.  Other presidents demanded they give up something first, which they refused to do.  This time they got it for freezing their  nuclear weapons tests for a while.    Not rollback, not give up, just hold off.   They already got what they want so stopping now is fine for them.  They have the missiles  ( most likely from Russia ) and the nukes to go on them. 
Mike Pence couldn’t even get a gay olympian to meet him, what will we have to give to make tRump come out the big man he thinks he is.
