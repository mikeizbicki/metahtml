pool, you most likely are, at one time or another, aware of the chlorine used to disinfect your municipal water. Although its
distinctive aroma may be unpleasant to some, it is an indication that your water supply is being adequately treated to stave off
harmful or deadly microorganisms. </p><p>Chlorine effectively kills a large variety of microbial waterborne pathogens,
including those that can cause typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera and Legionnaires' disease. Chlorine is widely credited with
virtually eliminating outbreaks of waterborne disease in the United States and other developed countries. And <i>Life</i>
magazine recently cited the filtration of drinking water and use of chlorine as "probably the most significant public health
advance of the millennium."

</p>

<p>Health officials began treating drinking water with chlorine in 1908. Previously, typhoid fever had killed about 25 out of
100,000 people in the U.S. annually, a death rate close to that now associated with automobile accidents. Today, typhoid fever
has been virtually eliminated. </p><p>Chlorine is currently employed by over 98 percent of all U.S. water utilities that disinfect
drinking water. It has proved to be a powerful barrier in restricting pathogens from reaching your faucet and making you ill.
Chlorine and chlorine-based compounds are the only disinfectants that can efficiently kill microorganisms during water
treatment, and maintain the quality of the water as it flows from the treatment plant to the consumer's tap. </p><p>Although
chlorine's value has been known for nearly a century, the mechanism by which the compound kills or inactivates
microorganisms is not clearly understood. The bulk of chlorine disinfection research, conducted from the 1940s to the 1970s,
focused on bacteria. Though limited, this work gave rise to some speculation. Researchers postulated that chlorine, which
exists in water as hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid, reacts with biomolecules in the bacterial cell to destroy the organism.
</p><p>Further work led to the so-called "multiple hit" theory of chlorine inactivation. It asserted that bacterial death probably
results from chlorine attacking a variety of bacterial molecules or targets, including enzymes, nucleic acids and membrane
lipids. </p><p>Early research efforts focused on how chlorine attacks enzymes. The disinfectant was able to inactivate extracts of
various enzymes because it is highly reactive with sulfur-containing and aromatic amino acids. But it had no effect on
cytoplasmic enzymes, suggesting that it might not reach biomolecules within the bacterium. Thus, researchers redirected their
attention to the molecules on the surface of the bacterial cell. </p><p>A new hypothesis proclaimed that perhaps chlorine acted by
attacking the bacterial cell wall. Proponents of this idea suggested that chlorine exposure might destroy the cell wall--by
altering it physically, chemically and biochemically--and so terminate the cell's vital functions, killing the microorganism.
</p><p>A possible sequence of events during chlorination would be: </p><li>disruption of the cell wall barrier by reactions of
chlorine with target sites on the cell surface </li><li>release of vital cellular constituents from the cell </li><li>termination of
membrane-associated functions </li><li>termination of cellular functions within the cell. <p>During the course of these events,
the microorganism dies, meaning it is no longer capable of growing or causing disease.

</p>

<p>Although chlorine's disruption of the cell wall appears to be the fundamental event leading to the demise of the
bacterium, the mechanism by which chlorine disrupts the cell wall had not been determined. Recently, though, scientists have
studied how chlorine affects the cell walls of "gram-negative" bacteria, organisms including those causing typhoid fever,
dysentery, cholera and Legionnaires' disease </p><p>By definition, gram-negative bacteria possess cell walls that consist of an
outer membrane and a cytoplasmic membrane. The outer membrane, being the outermost region that has direct contact with
the organism's environment, functions as a protective barrier. The investigation revealed that, for each bacterial species,
chlorination significantly increased the permeability of the outer membrane, leaving the bacterium vulnerable to destruction.
</p><p>How chlorine inactivates other types of bacteria has not been determined. Scientists do not understand much about
spore-forming bacteria or gram-positive bacteria, which have no outer membrane. Although these bacterial types are, in
general, more chlorine tolerant than gram-negative bacteria, most waterborne species do not normally pose a health threat.
</p><p>Certain waterborne viruses, such as enteric viruses and hepatitis A, may be even more tolerant to chlorine disinfection
than some bacterial species. But the means by which chlorine inactivates viruses is not well understood. </p><p>In recent years,
the parasitic protozoans <i>Cryptosporidium parvum </i>and <i>Giardia lamblia</i> have emerged as formidable
waterborne pathogens. These protozoa are remarkably resistant to chlorine disinfection and consequently, present a great
challenge to the water industry and health officials, who are responsible for providing safe drinking water to the public.
Currently, filtration is the most effective process for removing these protozoa from drinking water. To fully protect the public,
however, effective disinfection methods must be developed. </p><p>If chlorine kills so many species of microorganisms, why
doesn't it harm humans? Fortunately, when we ingest chlorinated drinking water, food in our stomachs and the materials
normally present in the intestinal tract quickly neutralize the chlorine. So chlorine concentrations along cell membranes in the
gastrointestinal tract are probably too low to cause injury. </p><p>This example may simply be another case of "dose makes the
poison." Like medicine, a little bit of chlorine, such as the levels used in drinking water or swimming pools, kills relatively
simple, but potentially deadly, microorganisms. At much higher concentrations, chlorine could damage the cells in our body.
</p><p>Water utilities carefully regulate chlorine levels so that they effectively kill disease-causing microorganisms but do not
harm people. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with the help of water utilities, environmentalists and chlorine
manufacturers, recently proposed a regulation that would reduce the chlorine concentrations in drinking water to assure that
the disinfectant does not approach unsafe levels. </p><p><b>Some additional details are provided by Leslie E. Dorworth of the
Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant College Program.</b> </p><p>Water has been treated for many centuries. First, it was boiled and
filtered to improve the taste and appearance. Chlorine, one of 90 naturally occurring elements, was first used as a disinfectant
in Europe and North America in the early part of this century. Since then, widespread epidemics of the most severe forms of
diseases have become exceedingly rare in the U.S. </p><p>In the U.S., Congress enacted the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974. The
law was amended in 1986 to expand the EPA's role in protecting public health from contaminated drinking water. The
amendments require the agency to control specific disease-causing organisms and indicators that may be present in drinking
water and to require public water suppliers to disinfect water. Amendments enacted in 1996 make it clear that any federal
agency is subject to penalties for past violations of the Act. </p><p>Chlorine can combine with natural organic compounds in raw
water to create some undesirable by-products; on its own, however, it does not usually pose a problem to public health. The
legislation regulates the by-products. One concern with chlorinated water is its tendency to form trihalomethanes (THMs),
carcinogenic by-products of the disinfection process. In 1979, the EPA adopted the THM regulation, limiting their allowable
level in drinking water supplies. In 1992, the EPA established federally enforceable standards that now cover 83 contaminants,
including THMs, that may be found in drinking water. </p><p>In order to address the EPA regulations--in this case THMs
specifically--water treatment plants changed operations to minimize THM production without compromising public health.
Some of the methods used include reducing the amount of chlorine; changing the timing during disinfection so that chlorine is
added in either sooner or later during process; changing the type of chlorine used; and removing the organic material that
reacts with the chlorine to produce THMs. </p><p>Although chlorine is not the only disinfecting agent available to the water
supply industry, it is the most widely used disinfectant in North America. Another form of disinfection is ozonation. Both
chlorination and ozonation kill organisms by oxidation. Ultraviolet treatment, another method, uses UV radiation to kill
microorganisms. </p><p>For chlorine to be effective against microorganisms, it must be present in a sufficient quantity, and it
must have a sufficient amount of time to react. This reaction time is called the contact time. For most water systems, the best
contact time is usually 30 minutes. To ensure continued protection against harmful organisms, a certain amount of chlorine
must remain in the water after treatment. The remaining chlorine is known as a residual chlorine. It is this tiny amount that
you sometimes smell in your tap water. </p><p>Most of us never think about getting sick or even dying from drinking water. But
in many developing countries around the world, diseases associated with dirty water kill more than 5 million people each
year, according to the World Health Organization. Without proper disinfection procedures, outbreaks in the U.S. would
significantly increase. </p><p>As researchers and officials have learned more about water disinfection, the use of chlorine in
treatment plants has been reduced. This reduction has been balanced by providing microbial protection and reducing the
by-products created through the treatment process.</p></li></div>
