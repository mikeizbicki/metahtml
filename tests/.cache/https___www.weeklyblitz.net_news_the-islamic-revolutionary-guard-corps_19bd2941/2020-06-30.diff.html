Its volunteer paramilitary militia, the Basij (Nirou-ye Moqavemat-e Basij, Mobilization Resistance Force), infamous in the West for organizing human wave attacks during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, has millions of members.</p><p>The university branch of the Basij, the Student Basij Organization (SBO), has played a critical role in monitoring and suppressing anti-government dissent among students, as <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=bbeabd3729&amp;e=f2bfb31242">shown</a>by Middle East Quarterly author Saeid Golkar, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga. It was instrumental in suppressing the massive nation-wide protests that erupted following Iran’s 2009 presidential election.</p><p>Unlike Iran’s traditional military and police, the IRGC does not answer to elected Iranian leaders and has frequently stirred opposition to their policies. But the wishful assumption of many Westerners that the IRGC is a “rogue” institution (the antidote to which is invariably engagement with elected “moderates”) is false. “The group has seldom engaged in activities not sanctioned by the Iranian leadership,” <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=33720dc20f&amp;e=f2bfb31242">concludes</a>Middle East Quarterly author Michael Rubin, a resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute. Answering directly, without intermediaries, to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, it is the purest expression of the Islamic Republic’s authority.</p><p>That’s not to say the IRGC is an obedient lapdog or doesn’t have an agenda. Elected Iranian leaders – especially President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-1997) – found that the easiest way to blunt IRGC interference was to lavish state contracts on companies owned by current and former IRGC officials. However, as Middle East Quarterlyauthor Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=5dd157b6f9&amp;e=f2bfb31242">explains</a>, in so doing they gave rise to massive IRGC conglomerates that dominate the Iranian economy – especially the energy, construction, and telecommunications sectors – and “a unified and consolidated elite” vested in protecting these interests.</p><p>Moreover, former IRGC commanders have risen to the fore of the political and cultural spheres in Iran. President Hassan Rouhani’s predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and nearly half his cabinet ministers were former IRGC officers. Alfonehthen <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=ae69fe4fb6&amp;e=f2bfb31242">warned</a>that the IRGC’s growing power could “make Khamenei a prisoner of his own Praetorian Guard, paving the way for a military dictatorship.”</p><p>However, so long as Khamenei and the IRGC maintain a united public front, it’s difficult to determine precisely who is calling the shots. The recent succession of unprecedented violent operations against Iran’s foreign enemies by the IRGC and its proxies (see below), which began two weeks after Khamenei abruptly replaced IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari with his more bellicose deputy, General <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=56284033b5&amp;e=f2bfb31242">Hossein Salami</a>, is consistent with either reading of the Iranian power structure.</p><p>External</p><p>The IRGC’s forty-year war against the Islamic Republic’s foreign enemies – spearheaded by its elite Qods Force – is a masterpiece of asymmetric warfare.</p><p>Early on, the Qods Force proved adept at cultivating regional proxies and clients well-suited to the geographic, political, and demographic conditions of their host countries. In Lebanon and southern Iraq, home to deeply aggrieved minority Shi’a communities, it established full-blown revolutionary movements in Khomeini’s image (Hezbollah and what’s now known as the Badr Organization, respectively).

However, opportunities for establishing an IRGC presence in most Arab states (including Syria, despite the Assad regime’s alliance with Iran) were limited prior to 2011 by their relative political stability. Since the so-called “Arab Spring,” however, the contraction or collapse of state authority in several key countries has made the Qods Force “an instrument perfectly suited for the moment that the region is currently passing through,” <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=d58f5de501&amp;e=f2bfb31242">writes</a>Spyer, and turned its leader, Maj.-Gen.

Rather than seeking to beef up the country’s uniformed military as per the West’s counter-insurgency playbook, the IRGC helped recruit, train, and finance a network of indigenous pro-government militias, supplemented by thousands of foreign Shi’a fighters.</p><p>Research on IRGC-backed groups in Syria by MEF research fellow Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, (see sidebar) illustrates the IRGC’s desire to operate within the system of an Assad-led Syria, rather than completely independent of it (as in Lebanon). Thus, most IRGC-backed groups are on the registers of the Local Defense Forces (LDF) and therefore affiliated with Syria’s official armed forces.</p><p>Though the LDF network is jointly overseen by Syrian military and IRGC officers, by 2015, according to Tamimi, Qods Force officers had taken over effective <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=e932585121&amp;e=f2bfb31242">command</a>of pro-regime assault forces seeking to recapture the Syrian interior. With the war in Syria now largely over, the IRGC has continued to expand its infrastructure in Syria, incurring periodic Israeli airstrikes.</p><p>Roughly the same thing happened in Iraq, where uniformed security forces of the Iranian-backed regime buckled before a 2014 ISIS onslaught that claimed large swathes of the country.
