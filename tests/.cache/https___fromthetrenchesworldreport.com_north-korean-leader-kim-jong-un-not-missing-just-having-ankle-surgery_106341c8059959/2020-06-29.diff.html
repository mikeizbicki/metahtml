Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.</p><p>Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice-marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global <ins>Times,</ins> <del>Times,</del> one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary on Monday titled: “For those who make up rumours of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”</p><p>Read more: <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/north-korean-leader-kim-jongun-not-missing-just-having-ankle-surgery-20141001-10ofvr.html#ixzz3Ew4W75mB">http://www.smh.com.au/world/north-korean-leader-kim-jongun-not-missing-just-having-ankle-surgery-20141001-10ofvr.html#ixzz3Ew4W75mB</a></p></article>
