                <p>[guest post by Dana]</p>
<p>While still in Vietnam, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-claim-that-kim-jong-un-didnt-know-about-otto-warmbier-at-odds-with-court-testimony">President Trump was asked </a>if he had discussed college student Otto Warmbier with Kim Jong Un.  The 22-year old had been detained in North Korea after being convicted for stealing a propaganda poster.  He was released after a year, only to return home in a comatose state and dying shortly thereafter.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Talking in Vietnam on Thursday about Kim&#8217;s role in the fate of Warmbier, who died in June 2017, Trump said: &#8220;He felt badly about it. He felt very badly.&#8221; He added that the two leaders had discussed Warmbier&#8217;s death privately. He added: &#8220;He tells me that he didn&#8217;t know about it and I will take him at his word.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/01/politics/otto-warmbier-family-trump-north-korea/index.html">Moreover</a>, claiming that he didn&#8217;t believe leadership knew about it, he  claimed that it would not have been in Kim&#8217;s interest to so severely wound an American:  </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Trump told reporters he believed Kim&#8217;s denial in part because it would not be in Kim&#8217;s interest for Warmbier to wind up in a coma.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that the top leadership knew about it,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that he (Kim) would have allowed that to happen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier in 2017, President Trump expressed his belief that Warmbier was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warmbiers-parents-push-back-on-trump-comments-blame-kims-evil-regime-for-sons-death">&#8220;tortured beyond belief by North Korea.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>As a reminder, during the summit in Hanoi, the president had referred to the murderous leader as a &#8220;friend&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Responding to the president&#8217;s belief that Kim Jong Un was unaware of Warmbier, his parents,  Fred and Cindy Warmbier <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warmbiers-parents-push-back-on-trump-comments-blame-kims-evil-regime-for-sons-death">rebuked Trump</a>, saying:  </p>
<blockquote><p>We have been respectful during this summit process.  Now we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that. </p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of the backlash for Trump&#8217;s comments, Kellyanne Conway did cleanup duty on Fox News earlier today:  </p>
<blockquote><p>White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway clarified in an interview Friday on Fox News, however, that the president agrees with the family and holds North Korea &#8220;responsible.&#8221; She said Trump was only saying there&#8217;s no indication Kim knew what happened at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he holds North Korea responsible. He has deep affection and shares the grief of the Warmbier family. That will never end,&#8221; she said.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-claim-that-kim-jong-un-didnt-know-about-otto-warmbier-at-odds-with-court-testimony">Jerry Dunleavy points out </a>that when compared with the testimony given by expert witnesses at the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/400779552/20181219-BAH-EH-Warmbier-v-Korea">evidentiary hearing</a>, Trump&#8217;s belief that Kim Jong Un was not aware of Otto Warmbier doesn&#8217;t hold up: </p>
<blockquote><p>Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korea specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and David Hawk, a consultant for the Committee on North Korean Human Rights who teaches at the University of South Florida, both testified that the North Korean government was responsible for the torture and death of Otto.</p>
<p>Sung-Yoon Lee said: &#8220;North Korea had been planning to conduct various provocative weapons tests all along, and to have a young American detainee would have provided North Korea not only with an added layer of security, a security blanket, but have a useful pawn with which North Korea could compel the U.S.&#8221; He added that &#8220;hostage-taking is a very well-honed craft and tool of North Korea&#8217;s diplomacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee said Otto&#8217;s detention was a strategic decision by the North Korean government: &#8220;I see calculated provocation, hostage taking as North Korea is preparing for a major provocation like its first nuclear test in three years, its first long-range missile test in three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee also agreed with the judge&#8217;s statement that &#8220;North Korea seized and maintained custody of Otto in order to further its policy goals.&#8221; He said that Otto was seized during a presidential election year in the United States and at a time when North Korea hadn&#8217;t tested a nuclear weapon in three years.</p>
<p>Yet &#8220;just four days after detaining Otto Warmbier, North Korea conducted a nuclear test on Jan. 6, which is two days shy of Kim Jong Un&#8217;s birthday.&#8221; And the &#8220;show trial and confession&#8221; of Otto was &#8220;very much a staple mode of operation in the North Korean system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee said: &#8220;Kim Jong Un is the Supreme Leader&#8230; In Korean culture, Korean history, the man on top has always held supreme power, the Korean kings of the past.&#8221; North Korea was &#8220;the most advanced, most perfected totalitarian state in world history&#8221; and had a unique ability &#8220;to coerce, to control, to terrorize people, and to invade their private realm.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Hawk spoke about the &#8220;systemic and regularized torture in the initial places of detention and interrogation&#8221; in North Korea. He was clearly being interrogated, and they wanted a confession from him. And he was obviously in his testimony scared for his life if he didn&#8217;t confess to hostile acts taken on behalf of the U.S. government.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Further:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Lee told the Washington Examiner: &#8220;The notion that Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader of the nation with the most rigidly vertical power hierarchy in history, was uninformed of the hostage-taking, torture, and extrajudicial killing of Otto Warmbier &#8230; is ludicrous.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Trump&#8217;s comments &#8220;challenge the letter and spirit of the landmark ruling by a federal judge in the case of Warmbiers vs DPRK&#8221; and &#8220;unwittingly empower the criminal regime of Kim Jong Un.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This would be consistent, given President Trump&#8217;s admiration for strongmen.  (See:  Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Xi Jinping, among others.)</p>
<p>As I was finishing this post, I checked once more to see if the President had tweeted about the matter, given the backlash he has faced.  Sure enough:</p>
 
 
<p>Interestingly, he doesn&#8217;t specifically call out Kim Jong Un as being responsible for the death of Warmbier.  Instead, he sticks with &#8220;North Korea,&#8221; essentially still giving Kim Jong Un a pass.  </p>

                <p>Stunning ignorance?  Naivete?  Or a true believer in the word of Kim Jong Un?  Just don&#8217;t claim it&#8217;s some game of 12 dimensional chess and we just aren&#8217;t smart enough to know&#8230;</p>

                <p>Kim is a murderous dictator who deserves to be shoved into a wood-chipper.  But that doen&#8217;t move negotiations forward.  Nixon negotiated with Mao and Chou.  We supported Somoza and Pinochet.  OUR hands have never been clean, and insisting they are is right up there with &#8220;Gentlemen don&#8217;t read other gentlemen&#8217;s mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump has gone the extra mile.  NO ONE can say that he did not try and try past the point of reasonableness.  Now, he&#8217;s done.  At least I pray he is done.  </p>
<p>Back to Plan A, as Trump himself explained long ago on Meet the Press:</p>
<blockquote><p>TIM RUSSERT, MEET THE PRESS: Let me talk about some of the issues. One is North Korea. And you say that you, as president, would be willing to launch a pre-emptive strike against North Korea&#8217;s nuclear capability.</p>
<p>MR. TRUMP: First, I&#8217;d negotiate. I would negotiate like crazy. And I&#8217;d make sure that we tried to get the best deal possible. Look, Tim, if a man walks up to you on a street in Washington&#151; because this doesn&#8217;t happen, of course, in New York. But if a man walks up and puts a gun to your head and says, &#8220;Give me your money,&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t you rather know where he&#8217;s coming from before he had the gun in his hand? And these people in three or four years are going to be having nuclear weapons. They&#8217;re going to have those weapons pointed all over the world and specifically at the United States.</p>
<p>And wouldn&#8217;t you be better off solving this really potentially, unbelievable&#151;and the biggest problem? I mean, we can talk about the economy, we can talk about Social Security. The biggest problem this world has is nuclear proliferation. And we have a country out there, North Korea, which is sort of wacko, which is not a bunch of dummies. And they are going out and they are developing nuclear weapons. And they&#8217;re not doing it because they&#8217;re having fun doing it. They&#8217;re doing it for a reason. And wouldn&#8217;t it be good to sit down and really negotiate something and ideally negotiate? Now, if that negotiation doesn&#8217;t work, you&#8217;d better solve the problem now than solve it later, Tim. And you know it and every politician knows it, and nobody wants to talk about it.
</p></blockquote>

                <p>Of all the sh!thole countries, the N.orth Korean people deserve a break. The people of Noth Korea are not crazy like the middle east. If Un makes a few decisions that lessen his nuke threat towards the civilized world the North Korean people would benefit having sanctions lifted. 25 million people creates a lot of consuming.</p>

                <p>The problem with the Kims is that they took nuclear reactor help under the provisions of the NNPT, whereby they gave up for all time any right to create or have nuclear weapons, and gained the assurance that such would not be used against them.</p>
<p>Then they used the reactors provided to create nuclear weapons.  This MUST be punished and it MUST end with the Kims having no nukes and no weapons-grade material.  If it does not, then the NNPT has to teeth and the umpty-ump other countries which made the same deal will feel free to renege, too.  </p>
<p>You had better believe that Iran is watching how this plays out.</p>

                <p>Consider the timing&#8230;</p>
<p>This was RIGHT before Trump&#8217;s lunch meeting that he walked out on Kim.</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t this be Trump hamfisted way of not poisoning the waters during a diplomatic negotiations?</p>
<p>What would ya&#8217;ll rather Trump do instead?  Call Kim out in a public press conference right before engaging negotiations?</p>

                <p>DRJ, do you accept the existence of negotiations without bringing up every point of contention?  Does the killing of the fool who went to North Korea change your view of the Kims, North Korea, or Donald Trump?</p>

<p>More important things on the table, such as trying to avoid a short but brutal war.</p>

                <p>Can you explain your hate/stooge comment?</p>
<p>Yes.  The discussion of Trump, or what Trump does, in inevitably played as a team sport.  There are the people whose hate overcomes them and leads them to attack normal behavior, and there are those that behave as his stooges, and who will defend any excess.</p>

                <p>Unforced error on the part of Trump. IF an error it was and not his usual game of creating tempests in teapots with the collusion of the #SlowNewsDay media. That was not the time or place to discuss Otto Warmbier and a younger, more mentally alert, and less doty person would have said so.</p>

<p>So, this is W&#8217;s fault for inventing torture?  Not sure what you mean.  Asphyxiation can happen lots of other ways, like a plastic bag, a pillow, or old-fashioned LAPD choke hold.</p>

                <p>@20. If you know how to hear to Trump, as NYers have learned from decades of ear-weary pressers, what the world saw was a tired old bullsh-tter w/his time-zoned bio-clock way screwed up, shoveling another rambling load of fertilizer. The man could have tucked in a line or two about compliments from Elvis when aliens landed a saucer of cream on the 13th green at Mar-A-Lago for a deal on building the Trump Tower/Venus and the crowd would have blinked&#8211; and listened on. He jetted out of Hanoi so fast, the doocy he pinched off at the hotel was still warm.</p>

                <p>News at 11! Trump is liable to say anything at any time. That was an unforced error, there&#8217;s no defending it, Warmbier erred in going there in the first place, but certainly didn&#8217;t deserve the treatment he received. Shame on Trump and may Kim and his underlings one day reap the whirlwind.</p>

                <p>@ Kevin M, 
</p><blockquote>Trump has gone the extra mile. NO ONE can say that he did not try and try past the point of reasonableness. Now, he&#8217;s done. At least I pray he is done.</blockquote>
<p>Where does it say that going the extra mile requires the President of the United States must publicly announce that he takes a murderous dictator at his word?  Wouldn&#8217;t a wiser man, a man who understands negotiations with thugs, simply keep his own counsel or simply give a no comment answer?  But to not only say that &#8220;this is what Kim Jong Un said&#8221; and then affirm what the thug said seems far more than just a negotiating ploy/tactic.  Where exactly is the line between obsequiousness, or foolish belief that what he says is true?</p>

                <p>For once, I think Trump&#8217;s statement is defensible. </p>
<p>Notice, first, that Trump was focusing on Warmbier&#8217;s death. He doesn&#8217;t say Kim knew nothing of the arrest or torture, only that Kim didn&#8217;t know how bad the torture was in this instance. Kim told him that Kim has wanted him to live, not die, and that the degree of severe treatment was not Kim&#8217;s intention. And that may have been true. As Trump pointed out, a dead hostage has no value (except in Hamas-Israel deals). </p>
<p>Whether or not Kim really knew the full details, I suspect that whichever members of the security forces who were directly involved in torturing Warmbier are no longer members of the security forces, and if still members of the living, are now recipients of the sort of treatment they used to give.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m pretty ok with Trump trying something different with N.K. I thought it was pretty foolhardy, but I&#8217;m willing to grant any president some leeway in taking a different tack. Sure, it was a complete failure, but sometimes things don&#8217;t work out.</p>

                <p>And then there&#8217;s this sweet memory&#8230;</p>
<p>Muammar Gaddafi&#8217;s Tent Finds Home On Donald Trump&#8217;s estate</p>
<p>&#8220;Muammar Gaddafi&#160;pitched his tent on an estate belonging to Donald Trump in suburban New York yesterday, according to reports. The Libyan leader is scheduled to attend the UN general assembly this week. He had been struggling to find a plot to accommodate the large Bedouin tent he takes with him when travelling abroad.</p>
<p>Workers were seen yesterday erecting a tent and satellites in the glamorous neighbourhood of Bedford on an estate owned by Trump. Local officials tried to stop them, saying it was illegal to build a temporary residence without a permit. An ABC News helicopter filmed a large tent on the 113-acre Seven Springs estate, with rugs and patterned wall hangings. Green and yellow fabric lined the walls in a pattern dotted with images of small brown camels, according to a local newspaper website image. Last night a state department official told AP the tent might be used for entertaining by Gadaffi, but he would not be sleeping there.</p>
<p>Doors all over New York have been slammed in the colonel&#8217;s face, but Trump says he has rented part of a large property in Westchester county to Middle Eastern tenants who may be associated with Gadaffi.</p>
<p>Gadaffi last month wanted to erect a tent in New Jersey, where the Libyan embassy owns property, but the US government said he could not. A request to set up tent in Central Park was also turned down.</p>
<p>Gadaffi arrived in New York yesterday, It is likely he will face protests over Scotland&#8217;s recent release of Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, convicted of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 which killed 270.&#8221;</p>

<p>#32:  We have the president we have, not the one we might want.  I can&#8217;t hold Trump to making subtly nuanced comments any more than I could hold Reagan to a grasp of the federal budget or Bill Clinton to keeping it zipped.</p>

<p>Dana, again, this is Trump. He is trying to humor a crazy man into giving up these nukes (that 3 previous presidents (four if you count Jimmy) let him build and keep).  Why?  Because he does not want to see Seoul get hit with one of them, and he doesn&#8217;t want to give the order to kill millions of people.  </p>
<p>And he can&#8217;t just let it slide; there&#8217;s a whole raft of countries wondering why they should play by the rules when Kim and the Mullahs don&#8217;t.</p>

                <p>While I think the method that Trump has chosen to deal with Kim is not ideal, as a practical matter, I don&#8217;t think anyone else would&#8217;ve necessarily gotten different results (for better or worse).

<p> If your point is that we are stuck wuth Trump, I agree but caring about how Trump conducts foreign policy with Kim is not a detail. Kim has nukes and says he will use them. You may be willing to trust Trump as he plays Monopoly with the world but there is nothing in his past or judgment that suggests to me he has the intelligence or ability to win.</p>

                <p>All you tough social justice warriors and Trump haters talk big. But if you are trying to talk a mad man into giving up his nukes in exchange for a big old promise from the USA that they won&#8217;t do you like Hitlery and Oblamo did to Libya, you don&#8217;t start out by blaming the mad man for the murder of a US citizen who was stupid enough to get arrested in NoKo.

                <p>Trump has clearly decided that flattery is the way to gain Kim&#8217;s confidence, probably because Trump loves flattery so much. But Kim lives in a nation where the lives of every person depend on their ability to flatter Kim. Kim&#8217;s need for flattery is likely insatiable and I doubt Trump can satisfy it, so this becomes an exercise in inflating Kim&#8217;s demands/expectations. That is not a formula for success.</p>
<p>The world has seen nuclear proliferation but we have gone almost 75 years without using nuclear weapons. Sanctions and detente were part of the reason why. Does Trump strike you as more like Reagan who used oil to pressure the Soviet Union, or like JFK who relied on instinct and personality in handling the Cuban missile crisis?</p>

                <p>Reagan backed a way from a bad deal, JFK had egg on his face from betrayal at playa giron and hence Khrushchev rolled him up at vienna, which led to Berlin and the bay of pigs, also moved in laos.</p>

                <p>The NoKo&#8217;s have cheated or backed their way out of every nuke and missile deal to date, including a &#8217;92 joint de-nuke agreement with South Korea, the &#8217;94 Agreed Framework under Clinton, Bush&#8217;s 2005 Six-Party Joint Statement and 2007 deal and 0bama&#8217;s 2012 missile freeze.

                <p>As has been said, Iran and other bad actors are watching how this plays out. IMO, it can&#8217;t be said Trump has not made a good faith effort to deal with the problem.</p>

<p>I am not playing any gotcha games with anyone, but I can immediately think of one thing that &#8220;suggests to me he has the intelligence or ability to win.&#8221;  He is the President. He also enjoys an advantage that few in history can claim;  he is constantly underestimated.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Trump has clearly decided that flattery is the way to gain Kim&#8217;s confidence, probably because Trump loves flattery so much. But Kim lives in a nation where the lives of every person depend on their ability to flatter Kim. Kim&#8217;s need for flattery is likely insatiable and I doubt Trump can satisfy it, so this becomes an exercise in inflating Kim&#8217;s demands/expectations. That is not a formula for success.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with you, it is not a formula for success &#8211; if the carrot of flattery alone is used.  Trump walking out on Kim suggests that POTUS is transitioning to the stick now.</p>
<p>Flattery.  But a President&#8217;s flattery is singularly different from what Kim gets at home; Trump&#8217;s flattery is not without real value and possibilities.  Kim&#8217;s underlings can offer him no more than loyalty grounded in fear.  Trump however, can offer Kim much, much more.  It is tempting to say &#8220;Kim won&#8221; or &#8220;Kim got the better of Trump.&#8221;  I doubt Kim thinks so.  No one walks out on him at home.</p>

                <p>@78. Meh. Even in orbit, what goes around, comes around. </p>
<p>Actually, in a little remembered &#8216;epilogue&#8217; quilled by Clarke to book from &#8217;69 titled &#8216;First Men On The Moon&#8217; by the 11 crew, he discusses and predicts the inevitable shifting of low-earth-orbit ops to private firms for commercial development freeing up NASA and other nations developing their own space agencies to press on with exploration w/beyond-earth-orbit ops.  Half a century later, that&#8217;s essentially what&#8217;s happening.</p>

The man holding some lousy hands has managed to bluff his way into winning several sweet pots. </p>

                <p>107.  I know you didn&#8217;t.  What I meant, and what I am saying, is that knowing how to become or be president does not mean one is smart.  We&#8217;ve had smart presidents and dumb presidents.  And I simply believe there is more evidence that Trump tends more towards the latter.</p>

                <p>there is nothing in his past or judgment that suggests to me he has the intelligence or ability to win.</p>
<p>You go to war with the President you have.  Or maybe we wait for President Harris?  Things CAN get worse.  I am not sanguine about &#8220;MAD&#8221; here.  Not only does it give the OK to proliferation, but it allows Kim to engage in nuclear blackmail which will only end the way all blackmail does.  Waiting will just increase the danger.</p>

                <p>The policies were successful, Haiku. Proliferation was inevitable. </p>
<p>The why did we offer so many carrots, and threaten so many sticks, to get all but a very few nations to sign on to the NNPT?  Not only was proliferation not &#8220;inevitable&#8221;, it was STOPPED.  Only India, Israel, Pakistan, and South Sudan refused to sign.  </p>
<p>North Korea and Iran DID sign, and got the promised benefits.  It was a blood oath and it needs to be enforced.</p>

<p> Its defensible; it sounds almost irrefutable that it would not have been in his interest to kill Otto Wambier &#8211; but that is a fallacy.</p>
<p>Kim only decided later he had to release Otto Wambier, and then he couldn&#8217;t let him tell a tale.</p>

                <p>Un may not have known exactly what was going on with Warmbier, but he is responsible for running an iron fisted society filled with vicious mini me tyrants. 
The worst people to run afoul of in societies like NK and Burma are lower level military officers and low level officers in internal security. If they want to climb the ranks, and they do, they will have been so indoctrinated in the hatred and suspicion of westerners that the beatings would seem pre-sanctioned.</p>
<p>When I was in Burma up north of Putao, we were walking up into the ethnic Tibetan region. 
The Burmese military maintains a crude series of outposts with forts made from sharpened stakes in the region where every westerner must check in or else you&#8217;d be suspected of being a &#8220;western stooge&#8221; and arrested as a spy. Spies get their confessions beat out of them. So we&#8217;d stay overnight, buy a few chickens for the dinner we were invited to host, give the Lt. a pack of Marlboros, a couple whiskey singles as a parting gift. No photos of the fort, no souvenirs.</p>
<p>We were told that if suspected spies showed up, there would be reprisals down through all the villages they&#8217;d passed through, so not only would I be responsible for my own ass kicking, I&#8217;d have gotten others hurt too</p>

                <p>Donald Trump: 
</p><blockquote> Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. </blockquote>
<p>  Donald Trump probably caused the death of Otto Warmbier!  </p>
<p>Kim Jong Un feklt he had to release Otto Warmbier because he needed it as a conditioon of meeting Donald Trump, and he was afraid of Donald Trump after Trump had tweeted: </p>

</p><blockquote>
Donald J. Trump&#8207;&#61490;Verified account&#61593; @realDonaldTrump  
<p> North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the &#8220;Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.&#8221; Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!  </p>
<p>4:49 PM &#8211; 2 Jan 2018  </p></blockquote>
<p>  My button works!  </p>
<p>Meaning maybe his &#8220;button&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work; i.e. the U.S. has sabotaged something, or could destroy missile in flight, and Donald Trump has a loose lip. Trump had been trying to alert Kim that if he tried to use nuclear weapons, he would suffer destruction &#8211; he would lose. And herer he was telling him that the United States was not afraid of what he might try. Kim Jong Un almost instantly reversed course, and stopped all his threats. He had to negotiate &#8211;   he had to stall Donald Trump.   </p>
<p>And to do this he has to release Otto Warmbier.</p>
<p>Problem: Otto Warmbier had undergone too much torture; seen too many other people suffer; or had contact with some long term secret political prisoners, whose names he could reveal, maybe Japanse it doesn&#8217;t want to admit it is still holding or North Koreans who could have told him tales &#8211; maybe even about the nuclear program, or whatever they felt they needed to keep highly secret &#8211; for the North Korean state to feel that they could release him. (I mean the way they felt they felkt they couldn&#8217;t, or were afraid to. It is not like this is actually necessary or would make a difference, except for fools, and there are very few real fools who deal with North Korea.)</p>
<p>Kim&#8217;s solution:  Release him, alive, but in such a way that he will never regain consciousness.  </p>
<p>(North Korea probably didn&#8217;t expect the Warmbier family to turn off life support, so they thought they were safe from an accusation of having killed him.)</p>
<p> That&#8217;s  what probably happened.</p>
<p>He was originally tortured because Kim just had to have a show trial where he confessed &#8211; it was not enough to give him along sentence over his protestations of innocence or in total secrecy. At that time it was expected he&#8217;d be kept locked up for a very very long time. So they didn&#8217;t worry about who or waht he would be exposed to, or what would happen if he was released.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Here is Trump saying he respects Putin.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Just words. When dealing with a foe, it never makes sense to belittle them (Life 101). What matters is President Trump&#8217;s actions, for example the commitment he recently got from the EU to purchase American LNG (liquid natural gas). If that&#8217;s not a boot to Putin&#8217;s throat, I don&#8217;t know what is. (Just ask anyone from the oil patch.)</p>
<p>I suppose Vladdy can bask in the chimera of Trump&#8217;s approbation. But he knows &#8211; unlike those who continually underestimate Le Grande Orange &#8211; that Trump&#8217;s his daddy.</p>
