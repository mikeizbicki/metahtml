Why would one choose to look like the devil?..the 8th wonder of the world. A Chinese man has undergone plastic surgery to look like North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. Wang Lei is the spitting image of the 32-year-old ‘Dear Leader’ of North Korea, and has reportedly gone under the knife to enhance his likeness.

He was caught by photographers in Nanjing, capital of east China’s Jiangsu Province, after bumping into a fellow plastic surgery lover – and going on a date.

The real man; North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un

Wang Lei met Liu Zixuan, an actress based in Nanjing, at a plastic surgery clinic when she went for a check-up following a breast enlargement. The couple discovered their mutual interest in artificial body alterations and arranged to go on a gold date – inviting photographers to come along.



The pair attracted crowd attention as they walked through town and Wang Lei took it in his stride, waving back to ‘fans’ and posed for pictures.
